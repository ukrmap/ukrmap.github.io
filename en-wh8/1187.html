<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 1cm;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; text-shadow: none;" lang="RU">During the XVI -first half of XVII century. Europe&#39;s population is constantly growing.It concerns above the XVI century. During which the population of European countriesincreased from 69 million to 95-100 million people. The average population density in Europeincreased to 30-35 people per 1 square. km, which is approximately one third ofcurrent level. Population growth was particularly marked afterterrible times plague (Black Death) that ravaged Europe in the XIV century.In the first half XVII. growth rate decreased, and in the middle of the centurypopulation of European countries amounted to 110-115 million people. Reasons for increasepopulation were to increase fertility, improving living conditionschanges in the diet of Europeans.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 1cm;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; text-shadow: none;" lang="RU">Average durationlife was 30-35 years, which does not exclude the presence of people whoreached old age. Most of the men died at the age of 40-60, women - 20-40years. As before, the infant mortality remained high: only halfof them reached the age of ten. It was connected with the lack of medicalcare during childbirth, disregard of basic rules of hygiene. Hospital inmodern sense simply did not exist, were only shelters for the terminallysick, elderly and disabled people.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 1cm;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; text-shadow: none;" lang="RU">Terrible healthconditions, especially in urban areas contributed to the spread of diseases and epidemics. In XVI - firsthalf XVII. some parts of Europe have repeatedly struck plague. Underan outbreak of plague in the years 1629-1631, which encompassed almost the entire Mediterranean, diedmore than half the urban population. German plague devastated the land in1624-1630, 1634-1639 and in the end he was the Thirty Years War. The loss of population inthese countries accounted for 60-75%. Significant were also the loss of epidemicssmallpox, cholera, typhoid.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 1cm;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; text-shadow: none;" lang="RU">Population of Europenot just died from epidemics, but also from hunger in lean years, fires, wardevastated. Especially notable were the loss of war, associated with the beginninguse of firearms and the mass murder of civilians thatbecome standard practice of warfare.

Each will cut his throat with a knife. &quot; Were enormouslost during civil wars in France and the first panThirty Years War. Estimates are that only in the XVII century.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 1cm;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; text-shadow: none;" lang="RU">Most of the populationEurope at that time were farmers. Citizens accounted for 10-20% of the population.Only exceptions were the Netherlands, where there was a small region about 300cities and their inhabitants 60% of units of the total population. <b style="">Most cities preserved medievalappearance.</b> They were small, with 3-5 thousand people separated fromworld around the ancient walls, with narrow streets, where evennot withered in the summer of mud and feeding pigs. However, there were city-giants.Europe remained the largest city with a population of Paris 300 thousand souls.He conceded to Naples (270 thousand), London and Amsterdam (200 thousand), Veniceand Antwerp (150 thousand), Rome, Milan, Genoa, Bruges, Prague (100 thousandshower). These city-giants demanded daily supply of food, coal,necessities. Ways like blood vessels connecting themof villages and towns from where came the necessary things for their existence.Villagers surrounding towns specialized in producing necessary products.On the road appeared inns, warehouses for merchants who boughtpeasant production and supplied its cities.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 1cm;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; text-shadow: none;" lang="RU">Big cities wereconsumers not only products but also the centers of attraction for those who are not afraidCONVENTIONAL leave rural home in search of better lives. It is here were those whofelt the strength and desire to get an education, learn crafts, or those whochased from the village of deadlock and the threat of starvation. Not everyone, of course, achieveddesired. Many people have always remained in shacks suburbs.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 1cm;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; text-shadow: none;" lang="RU">Unlikesuburbs, downtown was all the cell where the wealthy livedcitizens, placed public buildings, churches, town hall, banks, officeslawyers. Due to lack of space for building more expensive land in the centercity, which stimulated construction of apartment buildings. <b style="">In XVI - first half XVII.European cities have started to grow up.</b> At the same time changedappearance of cities. Laid straight wide streets that city on peredilyalyseparate quarters. Italian architects were the first in Europe to developProjects ideal city, composed of squares or circles locatedhouses surrounded by trees and fountains. Cities need of sewer andwater supply, which had put an end to disease and antysanitariyi. In the XVI century. Projectsbegan to be realized in practice. In the ruined cities of Italy medieval houses,new wide paved streets, built multi-storey buildings androzplanovuvaly large squares. It was then turned to architecture classesartisans in the art. After a while the pattern of Italian cities have changedyour view of Paris and London. <b style="">GraduallyEuropean cities acquired a modern look.</b></span></p>
