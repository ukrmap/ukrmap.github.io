They feared that focus on social aspects could divide the national movement.Further development of political situation in Ukraine showed the falsity of suchpolicy. It turned for UCR loss of social support amongLabor groups of the Ukrainian population.</p>

<p>Further development of the Revolution promoted the revival of old Cossacktraditions in the creation of local self-defense militias. Together withrevolution Ukrainian society began to embrace anarchy. This is especially senses in rural areas where the population was forced to take careof self-defense. To this end, we started to write free Cossacks.</p>

<p style="background-color: lightblue; border: thin solid;"><strong>Free Cossacks </strong>- Voluntary military and militias for protection of Ukrainian statehood and law enforcement</p>

<p>The first basket of the Free Cossacks appeared in April 1917 inZvenyhorodsky district of Kyiv. Then began the formation of suchformed from the nationally conscious peasants and workers aged over 18years on a territorial basis of the Left, Volyn Zaporizhiaother regions of Ukraine.</p>

Enrollment inCossacks carried out on the recommendation of three members of the society that hadresponsible for subsequent acts of his ward. No feepublic order Cossacks were not fed.</p>
<p>The basic unit of the Free Cossacks were a hundred, which formed fromcitizens of one village or city. Hundreds of cooperating in a hut, hut - in regiment, and regiments of the whole province formed a basket. This formation ledelected officers. The supreme organ of society were a general meeting.</p>
<p>Cossacks participated actively in public life.

Honorary chieftain became the Free CossacksHrushevsky, head of military formations - P. Skoropadskyi andsubstituted chieftain - I.Poltavets-Ostryanytsi.</p>
<p>In resolutions adopted at the congresses of the Free Cossacks, clearlyit indicated the main goal - to support democracies insociety, fight the enemies of the Ukrainian people, to preventfratricide, to ensure law and order.</p>
