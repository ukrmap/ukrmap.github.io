providing training and education of children, and a lot of
homeless, educational leadership proposed to reorganize
School First Degree, putting her in a children&#39;s home base, which
child was not only under constant supervision but also becomes subject to
influence the educational system based on communist ideology. School
were replaced with second-degree vocational education, where
 Teens involved in the real process of production and had produced
 experts with the required state workers &#39;and peasants&#39; occupations.
Compared with 1917, the number of pupils in secondary schools increased from
1.7 to 2,25 million people. At the end of 1920 in Ukraine there were 21.9
thousand schools. Almost half of school education was
Ukrainian.</p>

1919 People&#39;s Commissariat of agitation and propaganda in Ukrainian

publications. Newspapers and magazines were published in Russian and Ukrainian languages.
The total number of printed propaganda in 1920 production
exceeded 18.5 million. The &quot;bourgeois&quot; newspaper
closed.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks sought to put the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; under control,
converting them into an instrument of communist education. However rebuild
 activities &quot;gap&quot; failed and the Bolsheviks in 1921 went to their
destruction. During the Civil War the Bolsheviks created their own system
