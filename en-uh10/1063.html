Major activitiesthis group of farmers, entrepreneurs were commodity productioncrops, crafts, trade and usury. <br>In Western Ukraine in 1904 national bourgeoisiebelonged to dozens of credit unions, 9 industrial andseveral other companies. Overall, it was quantitatively and qualitativelyweak. <br>Wing charitable entrepreneurs in Ukraine fell at the endXIX - early XX century. They often addressing social klopotalysyaproblems for their workers, in lean years, fed thousands of peasants,solved the problem of local life. For example, in Mliyevi nearsugar refineries, entrepreneurs Yahnenko, Simirenko builtplace for workers and employees in 150 buildings, dormitories formen and women.

<p>On the Edge of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. with the completion of the industrial revolution inleading branches of Ukrainian industry havelogistical and social preconditions for further developmenteconomy and industrialization. Thus, at the beginning of XX century. inDnieper Ukraine steel plant operated in 1917. Moststrongly developed in the steel industry and KaterinoslavKherson provinces. <br>In 1900 compared with the previous decade in production of iron and  steel increased by 27 times. Enerhoosnaschenist steelenterprises in Ukraine at 42 times the analogues of the Urals, andworker productivity steelworks was 6 timeshigher. In metallurgical plants are widely implemented, electricalengines. South metallurgical plants were sufficientlylarge. For example, the factory employed Uzovskij 6.5 thousand,Alexander - 4 thousand Kamyansko - about 3 million people</p>

<p>Transition metals in mineral oil caused high rates of new field of heavy industry - production of coke. Unlike coal mines, once it arose in a largeenterprises. Productivity installations coke millsamounted to 3,5-4,5 million pounds per year, while mines - 0,3-1,8 millionpounds. <br>South also became a center of agricultural machinery. InEkaterinoslavskoy province there were 33, Taurian - 19, Kherson - 16enterprises for the production of agricultural machinery and tools. Plants OdessaKharkov Yelyzavethrada, White Church, Kyiv played an important role inproduction of agricultural machines and vehicles, pumpssugar, distillery, sawmill and other industries.However, the machines made by Ukrainian enterprises, in theircost and inferior quality foreign. Few machines produced forof the industry, particularly engineering. <br>At the turn of the century is much faster than in other industrial areasRussian Empire, and Ore mining industry developed inDnieper Ukraine. Here over 75% of total outputaccounted for a large machine production. <br>Technically advanced large coal enterprises graduallygrew to form the vast production of coalindustrial Donbass. In the first decade of the twentieth century. powermechanical power in Donbass increased 10 times. It first startedexperimental use coal-cutter. But technical progress in thisnot gained wide industry development because it had large reservescheap labor. <br>Big industry sectors nationwide significance were sugar,flour, distillery. In industries that processedanimal products, has successfully developed leather. <br>In Western lands the processes of industrial modernizationcovered the oil industry. Significant changes have occurred withthe use of deep drilling. Increasing number of steam engines.Several decades of work in technical equipment naftodobuvanni muchincreased. If the mid-nineteenth century. in the industry had 5steam engines, the 1904 p. them there were already 347. EarlyXX century. oil industry suffered a technical reconstruction: closed small wells, pits, began drilling wellsdepth of 1000 m. As a result of implementation of the new drill technology increased annual oil production: from 40-70 tons in the last decade Nineteenth century. to 325 tons in 1900 p. <br>Step forward made a wood-working and chemical industries, whereearly twentieth century. worked on three major time activities (inBig bull in Transcarpathia in Turyi-Bystre in Perechin), eachwhich counted for 300-600 workers.
