About 3.5 million Ukrainian in the Russian army and 250-300 thousand in Austrian troops fought and died for foreign interest to them. Butthe worst was that the children of the same people, two redistributedStates were forced to kill one another. <br>Much of the territory of Ukraine found itself at pryfrontoviy area, inGalicia, Bukovina, Transcarpathia, the tail there were fierce battles. <br>The war had a devastating impact on the economy of the warring countriesare on the verge of exhaustion. Suffered the worst losses RussianEmpire and subsequently the Ukrainian lands in its stock. Ceasedforeign trade, stood vast Black Sea ports.
