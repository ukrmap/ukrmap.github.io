Very brave, he did not lose sanity at the hottest moments and skillfully managed the Army. So do not accidentally prince was a favorite of King Polish-Lithuanian state Sigismund, who showered his honors and titles. Polkovodnytska Ostrozky career began after defeating enemies in 90 years.

</B> After Krevsk Union, and especially after defeats Svydrygailo Olgerdovich many Ukrainian and Belarusian princes lost their portions. </Li>There was a gradual convergence <li> princely groups with other privileged states and consequently the single privileged status - the nobility. </Li><li> the middle of 15 century. in most Ukrainian lands confirmed the ruling of this structure: <b> <i> princes - lords - zem&#39;yany-Gentry - Gentry-Golota - armor boyars. </I> </b> </li><li> This structure continued until the mid 17 century. </Li>However <li> dried out even princes were more likely to get high, governments in less than gentle, even and rich, Shlyakhtich. </li><li> addition, the princes acted in public service to the Lithuanian, Polish and of keeping their principalities and receiving from state to private ownership and lifelong holding large land holdings. </Li>Yes <li> princely families Ostrozkykh Vishnevetskih, Koretsky, Chortoryyskyh, Zbarazk occupied leading government positions in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, sat on the board of the Great Prince, and the military marches were under their own flags. </Li> </ul><p style="text-align: center;"> <b> Loss Ukrainian princes and state roles </b></p><ul><li> With the increasing influence of the Polish princes lost their ability at the state level to decide the fate of their homeland - she began to increasingly depend on the will of foreign capitals: Free or Krakow. </Li>However <li> princely families still had power and authority to do local governance.
