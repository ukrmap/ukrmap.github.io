<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Administrative division andregional division </span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Austrian Empire, to thewhich included western lands, was a multinational state. Unlikefrom the Russian Empire, the &quot;patchy&quot; Habsburg Empire was no singleunified management, resulting in the earth, inhabited by Ukrainian,belonged to different administrative units of the monarchy. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">First under the AustrianHabsburg appeared Zakarpattya.U 1699 it together with eastern Hungarycame under Austrian Habsburg rule. But in fact, here dominatedHungarians. Ukrainian settlement Transcarpathia was redistributed into fouradministrative regions - comitates that subject Pozhonskomu(Bratislava) namisnytskomu Administration of the Kingdom of Hungary. The entire administrativejudicial, military and financial power concentrated in comitates intendedKing of the group of large landowners and administrators. Convened periodicallykomitatski meeting nobility. The population of Transcarpathia comitates endEighteenth century. consisted of about 250 thousand souls, of which 40% were Ruthenians.The vast majority of the population were peasants, enslaved Hungarianlandowners. Most of the Ruthenian elite belonged to the Catholiczmadyaryzuvalasya faith and received, thus the same privileges as the Hungariangentry. However, remained and those who remained faithful to traditions of its people.Basically they were representatives of the Greek Catholic clergy. It is for themcame the first &quot;adherents&quot; in Transcarpathia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As the first division of RitchieCommonwealth (1772) of the Austrian Empire entered Galicia.Been connected the land, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria took the title Queen of Galiciaand Lodomeriya. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On these lands were establishedcrown region (province) &quot;Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria&quot; centered inLviv, composed of Ukrainian (Eastern Galicia), and Polish(West Galicia) land. Province divided into 18 districts (district), withwhich 12 were Ukrainian part of the province.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This division existed until the mid-century when, after repeated changes and he was finally eliminated peredilylyProvince by 74 counties (of which 50 were in eastern Galicia).</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the attached land was distributedGeneral-management system. All administrative authorities in the provincebelonged to the governor (later - the governor), appointed by the emperor. Indistricts (counties later in) power belonged to the elder, in the villages -fixable age, but migrants with landowners mandatoram(Supervisors).

<p class="txt"><b style=""><i style=""><span style="font-family: Arial; color: red;">&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The highest representative body inProvince was the Diet, the leading position in which the occupied Polish nobility. ButDiet powers were limited, and its activity is controlled by the imperialadministration. Since 1861 created two separate boundary Diet - inGalicia and Bukovina, which operated before the First World War.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At the end of XVIII century. with almost2.2 million Ukrainian population of Eastern Galicia were 71%, Poles - 22%Jews - 6%. But the Poles in the realm of politics and economics were before, thenas peasants, and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic clergy were extremely serious.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Greek Catholic clergy wasactually, the only representative of educated among the Galician Ukrainian, and thatit started in the land of Ukrainian national revival.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Before 1861 separate countybelonged to the Kingdom of Galicia and Bukovina Lodomeria. Administrative Centrethis covered with beech forest land was Chernivtsi. At the end of XVIII century.lived here about 75 thousand souls, among whom were Ukrainian 69, Romanians - 26%.Ukrainian populated mainly Northern Bukovina.</span></p>

During the first half of the nineteenth century.Bukovina was considered one of the regions nayspokiynishyh Habsburg Empire.Active role in the process of awakening of the Ukrainian national life when shenot played, but in the second half of the century the situation is significantlychanged.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Rutenstvo</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Long time Polish rulecaused that Western Ukrainian lost his social elite andturned into the people who made it, they laughed as Poles, peasants and priests.After switching the power of the Habsburgs situation of the western Ukrainian significantlyimproved as a result of imperial reforms of Maria Theresa and Joseph II.This Greek-Catholic clergy, which started in the new conditionsplay the role of the Ukrainian elite, became committed supporters of the dynastyHabsburg. They advocated that the government strongly support the Viennese, withthanks perceived all that presented a imperial power, and for a long timenot trying to impose their own requirements. This historical phenomenon was called&quot;Rutenstva. The content of it was very difficult. On the one hand, &quot;rutenstvo&quot;impeded the development of the western Ukrainian national consciousness and helpedimperial officials to strengthen their power in the land of the other - washistorically caused by the real situation because the interests of Ukrainian matchwith the wishes of the Austrians to weaken the influence of Poland and Hungary in Galicia, Transcarpathia.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></h3>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Greek Catholic Church in Galicia</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Greek Catholic Church has longplayed an important role in Ukrainian Galician. During the CommonwealthGreek Catholic clergy undergone all sorts of oppression from the Catholic church.The Greek Catholic Church did not decline, but driven out of the social group of wealthystrata, was closer to the people. Greek Catholic priests lived in villages. OS-spratthem, unlike Roman Catholics were allowed to marry, their lives oftenresembled a peasant. They were forced to combine their spiritual duties withcommon peasant labor, earning the maintenance of their families. Their sonscontinued to deal mostly parents. The priests were well aware of people&#39;s languagetalking with people, because Latin and Polish-Ukrainian peasants notunderstood. Consequently, the Greek Catholic clergy was at that timehistorical conditions for the Galician Ukrainian the only possible social elite.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Go into the power of GaliciaAustrian Empire led to positive developments in the situation of the Greek Catholicchurch. Due to open in Vienna and Lviv theological training institutionsthere were opportunities for believers getting a good education. The implications of thisappeared very quickly. That work enlightened Greek CatholicUkrainian clergy launched a process of revival in Galicia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1808 by order of the AustrianEmperor restored the Galician Greek Catholic metropolis. First Metropolitan <b style="">Antin Anhelovych</b> (1808-1814 biennium) and<b style="">Michael Levitsky</b>(1816-1858 biennium) have done a great national awakening GalicianUkrainian.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Multi-activity Mikhail Levitskycoincided with the period of deployment in Galicia the Ukrainian national movement.Together with his supporters, he took care to establish public schools andtraining manuals for them.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For a long time Metropolitandemanded the introduction of teaching in the Ukrainian language in schools in Eastern Galicia.Anyway Levitsky was quite conservative in their views, not supportedEuropean supporters of new ideas. When members of the group &quot;Ruska trinity&quot;prepared for publication Almanac &quot;Dawn&quot; and &quot;Mermaid Dnistrova, namely Metropolitanbecame one of the initiators of their censorship ban. When the Russian governmentforcibly abolished the Greek Catholic Church on the Right Bank, it stronglycondemn this action.
