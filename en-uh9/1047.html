<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then followed denunciations, in whichUkrainian movement charged in separatism. Most effort to discreditUkrainian movement has made Michael Yuzefovych - Poltava landowner, formermember of the Kiev community. As a loyal minister of the empire he could notagree with the direction of Ukrainian business community.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Finally, disturbing reportsalarmed the king. In his order was established a special commission, whichrelied task of making the fight against ukrainophilesactivity. The Commission concluded that &quot;to allow a separate literature onracy of the Ukrainian dialect would be tantamount to putting the basis for durablybelief in the possibility of offices, and even in far buduchyni, Ukraine fromRussia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Wilderness Ems decree was somewhatsoftened in 1881, when it was allowed to print in Ukrainiandictionaries, though the Russian alphabet. The question of Ukrainian-Performancesolved since the local authorities. But in 1884, 1892 and 1895 hissupplemented by new restrictions.

They are also not to be printed, even if the content was quiteinnocent. Overall Ems decree remained valid until 1905</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ems decree had serious consequencesfor the Ukrainian movement, namely:</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. He limited the means bythrough which one could influence the awakening of national consciousnessUkrainian people.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Deterred the development of Ukrainianculture.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Has led to disruption ofcertain times of the Ukrainian movement in Dnieper Ukraine, but not itstermination.</span></p>
