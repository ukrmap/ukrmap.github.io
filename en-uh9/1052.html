<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. The constitutional reform of 60-ies inAustrian Empire</span></h3>

In the firstdecade after the revolution in the empire dominated response, which by last nameInterior Minister Alexander Bach was called Bach. The reaction isled to the revival of the old order, and became a form, which wasregrouping of forces in the Empire. Most influential forces were national elites(Hungarian, Czech, Polish, etc..) That were in opposition to the imperialcenter. Finding a common language with them, saved the empire from collapse. AcceleratedThis process is painful defeat of the Austrian Empire in the international arena.At first Austria lost the war against France and Piedmont in 1859 and failedhinder the process of unification of Italy and 1866 was defeated byPrussia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This defeat had far-reachingconsequences:</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">victorysmall kingdom of Piedmont, who fought for the unification of all Italianinto a single state, have become an example for leaders of nations, redistributedbetween various empires;</span></p>

</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Austrianpolicymakers had in 1860 restore the constitution. It was createdbicameral legislature - the State Council. In 1861 Austrianownership was defined as the autonomous province with its own representativebodies - the Saeima, albeit with limited powers;</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;

The largest of the Crown lands with its capital Kiev wereKingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Grand Duchy of Cracow andOsventsymskym Zatorsky and principalities, which included the Eastern Galicia and(Temporarily) Northern Bukovina with predominantly Ukrainian population.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For the Austro-Hungarian Galiciacompromise was supplemented Austrian-Polish, has noted that even during the reaction, andHis first real fruit evident in the early years of constitutional reforms. In1860 Interior Minister appointed the Austrian Empire PoleAgenor Goluchowski. When he was still governor of Galicia, took allPolish efforts to establish dominance in the region. The system of electionsGalician Sejm was arranged so that the Poles immediately got a majority. Byconditions necessarily compromise the governor of Galicia had appointed the Polisharistocrats (in 1866 they again became Goluchowski) and in Vienna Polishwas to protect the interests of the Minister of Galicia. All the social, economic andeducational policy was directed primarily at meeting the Polish interests.Polish officially introduced in the administration, judiciary, institutionsgovernment, Lviv and the Jagiellonian University.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Such an orientation pro-imperial center was due to increasing confrontation with the RussianEmpire, against which the Poles repeatedly raised the revolt (1830-1831,1863-1864 biennium), as well as assessment of the Ukrainian movement as pro-Russian.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Despite its imperfectionsconstitutional reform of 60-ies Nineteenth century. in the Austrian Empire hadfar-reaching consequences:</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Galician Diet</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Legislative basis forGalician edge of the Diet were two documents: National Charter andSejm ordinance Election 1861 Competence of the Diet, only1873, confined to the realm of culture, education, agriculture policy and more.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Diet structure and electoral systemto him under the social point of view was overwhelmingly transitional erabecause they combine elements of medieval birth-representative</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">­</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">ни</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">­</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">tskoho rights of parliamentary-democratictrends in modern times. The electoral law reflect the characteristic of histime understanding of society as an association of different groups of people with different&quot;Social and professional position, the merits of the state, lifestyle andpolitical consciousness. &quot; Representative body, that the Diet had to defendinterests of these groups according to their &quot;zasluzhenosti&quot;, which defined the property andprofessional qualification. Elections to the Diet took place every 6 years.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Galician provincial Sejm consistedof the 150 ambassadors from the six public categories. Total direct votersaccounted for 10% of the population (among the peasants, who made up 95.5% of the land -8,8%).</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This electoral law providedhalf the seats in the Diet ambassadors &quot;from the people.&quot; Theoretically, all these mandates mightwin the peasants, burghers, or their representatives, which resulted in crucial electionfight for votes in the ruling circles of common people.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The orientation of the electoral law tois, and not put on the national composition of the Ukrainian population in Galiciaunequal because of its predominantly rural character. Ukrainian theorycould get only a third of seats. This number, that mandate in 1951, Ukrainianobtained only during the first election in 1861 Subsequent electionsmarked reduction of the Ukrainian representative. In 1883 it waslowest - 12 ambassadors.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Polish and Jewish movementsWestern Ukraine in the second half of the nineteenth century.</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the liquidation of the Polishstate the Polish liberation movement faced the task of restoringstate associations in it all the Polish lands redistributed by three empires.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The most favorable conditions fordeployment of the Polish national liberation movement after the suppression of the PolishUprising 1863-1864 biennium in Russian Empire formed in the AustrianEmpire (from 1867 - Austro-Hungarian monarchy), where duePolish-Austrian compromise Galicia gained autonomy in which the leadingpositions occupied by Poles. People compromise cherished hope to turn in Galicia&quot;Polish Piedmont, around which the future will mergePolish lands within the historic boundaries (ie 1772). In Galiciahad formed a model for future Polish state. Galician Sejm in thesystem belonged to a defining role. He, on the one hand, considered the successordiets of the old Commonwealth, which proves the continuity of statetraditions, on the other hand, being the only Parliament in the lands redistributed Polandhe would serve the interests of all people, be an expression of his will to the world.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Such positions comply withCracow conservatives (stalchyky). They also condemned anyviolence and urged the Polish people to take a position on the loyalAustrian emperor, who, according to international agreements, was lawfulheir to the Polish throne. In the policy of the Ukrainian population, theyPolish public is encouraged to compromise.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Stalchyky, although they were numericallysmall group covered almost all major public offices, affecting thePolish policy of the emperor.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Political rival stalchykivConservatives were the eastern Galician (Podolyak), Cracow and LvovLiberal Democrats. Last demanded from the emperor of the same Polesrights as the Hungarians, and election reform. Podolyak, although generallysupported stalchykiv, categorically rejected the possibility of any agreement with Ukrainian.Both indicated the current (conservative and liberal) have been mainlyrepresented the Polish aristocracy, who held the power in Galicia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the second half of the nineteenth century.vyriznylys and new trends in the Polish movement - the people of (national or rural)socialist and that gaining strength and early twentieth century. taken a leadingposition. Their appearance was characteristic of a new era when growing rapidlyPublic consciousness of the general population, formed massivepolitical movements. The idea of burns of the upper classes of the people betrayed in the past.The peasants and workers increasingly loudly declared their right toexpress and defend their own interests.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Recent trends, though alsopolitical opponents to the Conservatives and Liberals, on the Ukrainian question isoffered nothing new. The only thing which they acted jointly with the Ukrainianmovement - a requirement for electoral reform and social rights of the population. RightUkrainian population in their own state, let alone in the region have stronglydisputed.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In addition to Ukrainian and Polish,influential community land was Jewish. In 1880 it amounted to 11.52%population of Galicia. Most Jews lived in towns and cities, butlate nineteenth - early twentieth century. prominent feature of Galiciawas the growth of the Jewish community in the village. In the villages of Jews were mainlyKorchmar, usurers, bailiff and others. This structure of the estateJewish community reasonably perceived as Ukrainian peasantunfriendly, but the Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire, there was not.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the political sphere Jewishcommunity, especially its elite, was inclined to peaceful coexistence with the authorities, soto cooperate with the Poles. Some even called for a voluntary Polishassimilation. Many Jews became a true Polish patriot (in Hebreworigin, pole at understanding, preferences). But this trendJewish community only lasted to the early 90&#39;s This stemsthat movement in the Polish anti-Semitism began to grow. The reaction to it wasspreading the ideas of Zionism. Zionist ideal was the formation of a Jewish state inPalestine, but the main goal in Galicia - the struggle for the preservation of Jewishnational identity. This change of priorities in the Jewish movementand negative influence on Ukrainian-Polish conflict: Jews in it occupied mainlyneutral, and sometimes supported the Ukrainian people.</span></p>
