<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the second half of the centuryWestern Ukraine population increased. AccordingAustrian and Hungarian state censuses of 1857 and 1900, theWestern Ukraine was just under 2600 and 3814 thousand thousand Ukrainian.As for this segment the total population has increased significantly,Ukrainian share in its stock dropped. The growing populationincreasingly aggravated local socio-economic problems. In Galiciapopulation density in rural areas during this period increased from 32to 102 persons per 1 sq. km. km.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the second halfNineteenth century. socio-economic characteristics of the western lands was notundergone significant changes. They remained an agrarian society, since 95%trudylosya population on earth, and about 1% worked in industrialenterprises. Western intellectuals, including the local clergy,was numerically small. Thus, in eastern Galicia, it was about 0,5%of the total Ukrainian population. At the same time the Poles, for example,accounted for 22% of the inhabitants of eastern Galicia, and their intelligence was over 3%total population.</span></p>

<p class="aa"><i style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Note</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial;">. At Trans 85%population at that time worked in agriculture, 10% in industryand transport.</span></p>

<p class="6"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Living conditions in the Westlands have been extremely serious for the indigenous population. The living standards of WesternUkrainian was only one tenth of the general standard of living the rest of the populationon these lands. Mortality reached 40-48 people per 1 thousand and 28 among the Ukrainian people1 thousand among Poles. Number of products consumed by one person inGalicia, was only half of what he ate citizenWestern European countries. According to historians, every year from hunger, malnutritionand disease in Galicia itself only 50 thousand people died. More than half of children notsurvive to 5 years, sometimes dying from diseases due to elementarylack of medical care. In western and central provinces of the empireHabsburg one hospital accounted for 295 residents, and in Galicia - in 1200.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Features of Economic DevelopmentGalicia, Bukovina and Transcarpathia</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Revolutionary events1848-1849 biennium were an important stage in the development of European countries. Despitethat the revolution ended in defeat, they made it possible to speed up the processfurther development of industrial society. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A completely different situation toWestern lands. After 1848 feudal order is notimpede economic growth. However, the western land tolast days of the empire remained the most backward in the economicplane of the territories of Austria-Hungary with the lowest standard of living.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, thankspolicy for the Vienna and western and central provinces of Austria-Hungaryrapidly developing industry, and Galicia, Bukovina and Transcarpathiapreserved ancient, agrarian nature of the economy. Its development in Westlands increasingly defined interests in large-scale industrywestern provinces.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The imperial government actually did not useany measures for industrial development at Western. Governmentrange of West Ukrainian businessmen refused to give tax reliefthose used in the western provinces. Access West Ukrainian goods onmarkets of Austria-Hungary and neighboring countries was actually closed. Simultaneouslythere were incentives for the export of raw materials and semi-finished here. Eveninside edge of West Ukrainian entrepreneurs was very hard to keep competitiveagainst foreign firms. Cheap factory goods are squeezed from the market placeproducts.</span></p>

Foreign businessmen absorbed all the companies whose existencewas undesirable to them, make it impossible the creation of those activities are contrarytheir interests. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">AgricultureWestern Ukraine has developed very slowly. Huge landtracts were owned by landlords, while most peasants constantlysuffered from the shortage of arable land. The natural population growth moreaggravated the situation. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Economic situationWestern lands in Austria-Hungary still remainedclose to the Colonial. This land was a market for finished productscentral regions of the empire and the source of raw materials. At the same time he wasreservoir of cheap labor, which came from here to Easternand overseas labor markets.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. The development of industry</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In unfavorable conditionsAustro-Hungarian rule of Western industry developedslow pace. The vast majority of industrial workers are not workingin large-scale industries and to small enterprises and workshops. Byofficial figures, 1885 in Eastern Galicia in 175 companiesmanufacturing industry with the number of workers over 20 were only 10 thousandshower. In Transcarpathia, but then there were several such businesses, and all of Bukovinawas not.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Branch structure of industryland was one-sided. The bulk of the product gave the field of mining andprocessing of local raw materials - forest, wood, oil, brown coal,salt. The biggest industry was the oil industry, which began to develop withmid-nineteenth century. Center for the oil industry was Borislav. Controldevelopment of this industry immediately set Austrian and German businessmen.The interest in increasing exports of oil Galician encourage them toapplication of technical improvements. The result was growthOil production from 20 tons a year in 1874 to 326 thousand tons in1900 But the Viennese government prevented construction naftoperehinnyhplants in eastern Galicia. Galician oil processed into Austrian andHungarian plants. Although oil and kerosene production steadily increased,farmers had to buy it for that and lit their homes splinters.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Foreign oil tycoonsin predatory plundered natural resources of the land, receiving huge profits.Joint campaign that operated in the province, to pay its shareholders a dividend ofrate of 20-27% per annum. Such high profits have never received the shareholders inwestern parts of the empire.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A large number of highwoods (oak, fir and beech) resulted in the second half of 1960 - the beginning70&#39;s rapid development of the lumber industry. In forest areasCarpathians was summed railways and mahogany exported toGermany, Austria, Italy, England, France, Turkey and other countries. EarlyTwentieth century. taken out of the Carpathians annually 608 million cubic meters. m of the forest.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If the sawmill industrydeveloped rapidly, the pace of furniture manufacturing and other industriestimber industry was very slow. Requirements of the Westernpopulation in furniture, paper and cardboard satisfied imported products.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the least developed areasowned light industry and metal processing industry. Local weavers,shoemakers and tailors clothing and footwear provided only the rural population, andcommoners wore western clothing fabric textile mills. &quot;Products fromfabric and yarn from the shirt until the carpet, - wrote a contemporary GalicianEconomists - iron and metal products, tools, machinery, fertilizers ... wordall that person needs from cradle to grave until, almost all imported,buy, lend to others.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The largest companies in the landwere railroad repair shops in Ukraine, and Stanislav Stryi. Butdo they repair was not possible, and machines were sent toGermany. Formation of plant industry in the land wasextremely slow. In the second half of the nineteenth century. in the land wereOnly five large state-owned tobacco factories (Eastern Galicia -four in Transcarpathia - one), employing four thousand workers. InEastern Galicia there were also several match factories, steel andbuilding enterprises.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The development industry has been associatedwith the emergence of new social groups - industrial workers.In the late nineteenth century. their number in the land was about 55 thousand souls.The sources of replenishment of the working class were ruined artisans and peasants.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">State of Westworkers was among the worst in Europe. In pursuit of high profitsentrepreneurs are reluctant to spend money to create safe working conditions.Consequently, the constantly increasing number of accidents. Inmining Transcarpathia their number was several timeshigher than in the central provinces of the Empire and other Western European countries.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Appalling living conditions wereBorislavskoe oilman. Most lived in their barracks, where an outbreakjust on the floor. Some workers spent the night outdoors. Workers employed-camp, spent the winter in dugouts. Business Day Westernworkers took an average of 12-18 hours.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Salaries industrialworkers in the province was a half times lower than in central areasEmpire. According to official figures of Austrian institutions, wages of workers in Lvivaccounted for 48-58% of wages of their counterparts in Vienna. Often (especially in and Borislavat the timber) published earnings are not money, coupons, whichworkers could get the products at higher prices only in the store business.Widely fines workers under various pretexts. Sometimes sizefee income reached several days. Size paid industrial workersdid not provide them a living wage.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Severe working conditions and lowliving standards among workers were causing the spread of diseases such astuberculosis, rheumatism, etc.. Medical care because of its high costwas almost inaccessible to them.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. Changes in agriculture</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Agricultural reforms implemented inWestern Ukraine during the revolution of 1848-1849 biennium, the peasants uvilnylyremnants of serfdom, but their situation remains very serious. During hisfreeing peasants had for 50 years to pay annual fees. Ingeneral reform of 1848 Western peasantry cost over 300million florins.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In favor of the landowners to resolveand the land question. Although under the reform for the peasants had to be keptthose lands, which they enjoyed, they stripped the landlords more fertile grounds.West-land became the land, where agriculture majorpicture were small sized farms 2.5 hectares and large landpossession of 15-20 hectares.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Consequently, the Evolutionagriculture took place very slowly. In economic relationspeasants and landlords dominated the refining - with borrowed grain as rentearth, wood and more. Only in the late nineteenth century. refining steel yieldfree &quot;work place. About 80% of farms were putless than 5 hectares(Remember that portion size could provide the minimum needs of the farmer).Consequently, most farms were doomed to poverty,ruin and decay.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One of the main issues forfarmer at the time was right to use the servitude. Landownerspreviously administered excessive price for their use, knowing that ultimately leadfarmers anywhere. Hopes of thousands of peasants to find justice in the courts wereuseless. During the 1848-1881 biennium land in the courts considered 32 thousand casesrights on easements from landowners whose benefit it was decided to 30 thousand</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Inability of most farmersto provide for necessary by the work in its own economy forced themnaymytuvaty go to big landowners. However, for their work, they receivedfour times less than the agricultural workers in other provincesHabsburg Empire.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">New problem in napivzhebratskomulife of the Western peasantry was usury. Forced to borrow moneyto pay many taxes, farmers quickly found themselves depending onmoneylenders, who, resorting to shameless fraud, under the pretext of a debt andinterest on it (on average 150-250%) taken away their business.The result was impenetrable plight of the peasants spread drunkenness. Landownersmost often pushed them to this, saying that instead of wages for work laborercoupons that they can be realized only in the pub. It is not surprising that in the endNineteenth century. Eastern Galicia fell one pub for every 230 inhabitants,While primary school - for every 1500. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The main branch of agriculturefarms in the province was agriculture. In impoverished rural progress in the wayscultivation of the soil was very low. The level of mechanizationagricultural land in western significantly inferiorother regions of Austria-Hungary. A large number of cheap labor landlesspeasants did not profitable import expensive machinery from the western regions of the empire oreven from England. Slow progress implementation agronomic science behindland cultivation machinery indication to low yields. During the second halfNineteenth century. yield of crops in the land washalf to two times lower than in Western countries.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">And yet, though slowly, lookwestern village changed. The vast majority were malozemelnieconomy, the owners of which could not survive on their holdings. Localunderdeveloped industry was unable to absorb surplusagricultural population. Farms middle and wealthy peasants werethe foundation from which could form a new social group of Westernrural entrepreneurs. Unlike the urban bourgeoisie and the landlords, farmers, entrepreneurswere mainly Ukrainian.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. Beginning Ukrainian labor migration</span></h3>
