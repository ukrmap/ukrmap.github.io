<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Development of education in the 70-90&#39;sNineteenth century.</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the second half of the nineteenth century. Asand the first development of Ukrainian culture held in colonizationpolitical regimes that prevailed in Ukraine. The most popular are plaguededucation. Elementary and secondary schools was not enough. Until the abolition of serfdomin Russian Empire (1861) Education in Ukraine, especially primary,downfall. Nobles thought that farmers do not need education. Imperial Government almostusunuvsya completely from the material maintenance of primary schools.</span></p>

He moved toStrasbourg, where he studied electrical engineering. In 1877 received academicPh.D. in physics specialty. Next year the WorldExhibition in Paris Pul&#39;uj awarded for inventions physical and electricaldevices. He was invited to teaching. In 1902 he became the firstDean first in Europe, Faculty of Electrical Engineering. His creative personalitywas conspicuous in electrical engineering.

Having occupied the chair, I have seven semesters with a number of(1894-1897 biennium) read the general course of history of Ukraine. Then repeatedthe second time again with R. 1898-1901, is this course was to serve like a skeleton of thatPlanned history.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Contribution of the Scientific SocietyShevchenko in the formation of national science</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If the bank Ukrainescience developed as part of an all, we in the Westlands were laid the foundations of national Ukrainian science. Its centerwas Shevchenko Scientific Society (Shevchenko Scientific Society) - scientific and cultural publicorganization founded in 1892 Progressive Ukrainian public expenseLviv and other cities in Western Ukraine. The predecessor was NTShLiterature by Shevchenko Scientific Society, founded in December 1873Society was formed as the prototype of the Academy of Sciences - withhistorical and philosophical, philological, mathematical and natural-drugsection and subsection, from the edition of &quot;Records, books, magazines.Active members of the community and elected honorary members. Along withresearch activities conducted NTSh cultural and educational workpopulation. NTSh united experts in different fields of knowledge, writers,cultural and public figures from Western and Dnieper Ukraine, otherStates. Active members and leaders were NTSh O. Barvinsky, Hrushevsky,Franko, V. Hnatiuk, S. Tomashivskogo et al.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The main merit of the company wasthat in the absence of Ukrainian statehood, it servedUkrainian Academy of Sciences. Creative works NTSh (LNTSH) since 1873 on1939 amounted to 1172 volumes of various publications, including 943 volumes of serialscientific publications. In addition, the Shevchenko Scientific Society was the main publisher of Ukrainiantextbooks. Thanks NTSh were published in the first eight volumes of the monumental workHrushevsky &quot;History of Ukraine-Rus&quot;.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Major achievements were thesphere of social sciences: history (Labour Hrushevsky Dzhydzhora I., I. Krypyakevych,I. Krevetskoho, M. Korduby S. Tomashivskogo), philology and literature(Labour M. Wozniak, M.Derkach-Futrak, O. Ogonovsky, K. Studyns&#39;kogo, Franko)Ethnography, Folklore and Art (Publications V. Hnatiuk,Zubryc&#39;ka M., F. Kolessa V. Shukhevych), anthropology (F. Wolf, I. Rakovski)bibliography (I. Levitsky, V. Doroshenko) and others.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">NTSh had undeniable merits indevelopment of the Ukrainian scientific terminology. Historical Society rolewas to withdraw Ukrainian Ukrainian science beyond. Tomost important achievements of members of the Shevchenko Scientific Society in exact and natural sciences shouldinclude the discovery of cathode rays of Life Ext (subsequently namedX-ray) Horbachevskyi synthesis of uric acid in the works of Zubryc&#39;kathe theory of mathematics, the contribution of S. and W. Rudnitzkiy Kubiiovych in researchGeography of Ukraine and others.</span></p>
