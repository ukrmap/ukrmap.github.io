<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. The emergence of organizations in the DecembristUkraine</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Opposition sentiment thatdistributed to the Russian imperial elite, found expression in the emergence ofsecret organizations among army officers. Members of these organizationscalled the &quot;Decembrists&quot; by the Russian name of the month, which was theirattempted coup of December 14, 1825 in St. Petersburg. Ondistribution of these attitudes influenced acquaintance with inhabitants of European ideas andsocial and political life of Europe during overseas trip1813-1814 biennium Autocratic, feudal empire in order contrasted withwhat they saw and encouraged the nobility, who, after victory in the war feltown importance, decisive action.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Among the officers located atRight Bank after the withdrawal from Europe, 2 nd Army in Kamenetz-Podolskthere was a secret organization &quot;Iron Rings&quot; (1815). Company, a leaderwhich was W. Rajewski, elimination of feudal united supportersprocedures and the introduction of the republican form of government. After a year underthreat detection company samorozpustylosya. Secret of Officersoccurred while in other cities of the empire: in St. Petersburg - the UnionRescue &quot;(1816), in Moscow -&quot; Union welfare &quot;(1818).Sharp disagreements that erupted between supporters of the republican formgovernment and constitutional monarchy led to the collapse of these organizations.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1821 Right Bank, inTulchin created a new secret organization of &quot;Southern Company&quot;. Amongits members were many members of Masonic lodges. The leader began aColonel Pavel Pestel. A year later, in St. Petersburg, was formed &quot;NorthCompany, headed by Nikita Muravyov. In the ranks of both companies for1821-1825 biennium there were over 200 members. Managers of both companiesannually during the Contract Fair in Kiev, have held meetings at whichdiscussed programming questions.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">All secret society Decembristsdeveloped a political program, which was outlined their vision of the principles of restructuringRussian Empire.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Ukraine in the policy documentsDecembrist</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The program of future reforms&quot;Southern Company&quot; - &quot;Ruska Pravda&quot; produced Pavel Pestel. Heproject of empire had become a unitary republic with a unicameral parliament.However, for an unlimited period to implement these changes in the countrymilitary dictatorship introduced the &quot;Provisional government&quot; headed byPestel. The people guaranteed basic civil liberties, abolished serfdom.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At the same time refused Pestelrecognize the people to live in the empire, the right to separate existence as states.All nations were to merge with the Russian people, that is losing its nationalfeatures. Future Power, in his opinion, should be centralized countrybecause the federal system Pestel considered harmful. For Ukraine, which forit was only &quot;Little Russia&quot;, no public rights is not recognized. Through itsweakness - he said - &quot;Little&quot; can never become a separate state, andIt must give up those dreams. The right to own statehood recognized Pestelonly in Poland, and then only on condition that its close alliance with Russia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another vision for the future leader of the empire&quot;Northern Society&quot; M. Vorobyev. In its &quot;Constitution&quot; as he considered Russiafederal constitutional monarchy with a march on the U.S. model. Serfdomabolished, carried out democratic reforms. Country divided into 14federal states, two of which - the Black Sea with the capital Kiev andUkrainian with its capital in Kharkiv created the Left and Slobozhanschine.All issues of domestic life Ukrainian states have the right to decideindependently. In the center kept the right of a common foreignpolicy issue of money and creation of unified armed forces. Project M. Muravyovagave more rights to people, captive empire, however, the present stateindependence none of them received. States that they planned to createin Ukrainian lands were artificial in nature, since not all coveredterritories inhabited by Ukrainian, and tore it into several pieces of land.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In policy documents&quot;Society of United Slavs&quot; (&quot;Rules&quot; and &quot;sacramental promise&quot;)proclaimed the abolition of serfdom and the democraticrepublican system. Unlike other Decembrist organizationsCompany put forward the idea of liberation of the Slavic peoples of the monarch autocracyand combining them into a federation of Slavic republics. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoHeading7"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Excerpt from &quot;RecordsHorbachevskyi program bases on &quot;Society of United Slavs&quot;</span></p>

<p class="it"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&quot;Society was the main objectivedismissal of all Slavic tribes of autocracy, the destruction of existing betweensome of them hate and national reunification of all the lands inhabited by themin the federal union.</span></p>

<p class="it"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Supposed to pinpointborders of each State to implement all the nations of the democratic formrepresentative governance, forming the Congress to manage the affairs of the Union andto change, if necessary, the Basic Law, giving each state (right)elaborate internal structure and be independent in preparing some of its legality.</span></p>

<p class="bb"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Judge</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">: <b style="">1</b>. What was the purpose &quot;of the CompanyUnited Slavs &quot;? <b style="">2</b>. Whatwere to be the state structure and future members of the Slavicunion?</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This alliance, as proclaimed incompany documents, was to cover all the Slavic peoples who lived&quot;The four seas - the Black, Baltic, Adriatic, and Arctic. ToSlavic union republics were to enter Russia, Poland, Bohemia,Moravia, Serbia, Moldova, Dalmatia, Kroatsiya, Hungary and Transylvania.The supreme power in the federation had owned the General Meeting. CreationUkrainian state as an individual member of the union members of society (ho</span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="RU">­</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">cha among them were Ukrainian) is not anticipated.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Programming documents Decembriststestified that although Ukrainian lands were the main arena of the activities of organizationsUkrainian issue, they actually ignored.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Speech Decembrists and its implications</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">December 14, 1825, the daynew oath of Nicholas I, who ascended the throne after the deathAlexander I, the Decembrists revolt organized in St. Petersburg. Butconspired to refrain from action and would force the Government to accept theirrequirements only for the most of his act of civil disobedience. They brought on the Senatean area of 3 thousand soldiers with weapons and waited to meet their requirements. Evening of newEmperor gathered faithful troops executed rebels with guns.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Two weeks after these eventsraised a rebellion Chernigov Infantry Regiment, located in Kiev. GovernmentRetaliation against the rebels cast parts, January 3, 1826 defeatedrebels. Prydushyvshy performances, the government ruthlessly Decembrists.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Decembrist movement was primarilypro-nature and limited Army. He revealed that social movement toUkrainian lands can not win unless supported Ukrainian. PoliticalDecembrists indifference to the future of Ukrainian people (and otherpeoples oppressed Empire) led, among other reasons, to defeatDecembrists. Yet the Decembrist movement, despite its limitedcharacter, was the first in a new era attempt to eliminate autocracy, soinfluenced the development of Ukrainian national liberation movement.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">4. Promoting freedom-loving ideas in educationinstitutions</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Late 20-iesNineteenth century. opposition autocracy ideas spread in some trainingNaddniprianshchyna institutions. In their appearance influenced the events of the Decembrist movement andshowdown with him. In combination with Western ideas, which spreadamong high-school students and progressive teachers, theyled to the emergence of secret anti-government groups direction. Heated discussions thatoccurred in them, finding ways to release from imperial oppression,steel furnace, which shaped the views of representatives of the new Ukrainianintellectual elite - the intelligentsia.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In early 1826 secretcircle appeared at Kharkiv University. Headed by his young students -Vladimir Rozalion nobleman and son-Soshalskyy Kiev merchant Peter Balabuha.The members of group included about 20 people, among whom were students, employees,officers. Hurtkivtsi read banned books distributed and the most written worksagainst autocracy. V.Rozalion-Soshalskyy created several such works,the most famous of which was unimaginative pamphlet &quot;Ryleev in prison.&quot; In it heform of confession Decembrist Ryleeva condemned &quot;autocratic prymhlyvostigovernment &quot;in the Empire, lawlessness oppressed people, advocated natural lawevery person to free life. Circle existed year: once heunsighted imperial officials and smashed it. As suggestedImperial Minister of Education A. Shishkov, &quot;in schools should notspread wicked philosophising to the detriment of religion, government and publicsociety.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Distribution center on the Leftprogressive ideas was founded in 1820 Nizhyns&#39;ka senior high school science.A favorable situation for this occurred in school because of itsDirector<b style=""> John Eagle</b> (1771–1829).</span></p>

Together with other Transcarpathian Rusyns itfamous for those times that their reason called golden age in history.</span></p>

Under his leadership in these schoolsprevailing conducive atmosphere for learning, discussions, dating fromEuropean ideas. For views that are incompatible with the imperial ideology, an eagleaccused of a libertine and started investigation. From punishment Carpathianscientist rescued premature death.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In high school science Nezhinskythere was a secret &quot;free reading library. Those were the works of authorsforbidden by the imperial censors - Dzh.Bayrona, F. Wolter, S. Montesk &#39;isJean-Zh.Russo more. Maintained these high-school student works Nikolai Gogol, the future writer. InGymnasium secretly issued and distributed handwritten journals to which high-school studentswrote their works critical of the imperial order. Very popular intheir environment enjoyed the end of the French Revolution idealsXVIII century. The pupils often sing the anthem of revolutionary France &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;and sometimes sarcastic folk song - a parody of the king&#39;s anthem in whichstressed the need to destroy the imperial Romanov dynasty.I. leadership headed eagle school belonged to invasions of their studentsvery quiet, not punished and their &quot;no notice&quot; of their classes.</span></p>

In particular, Professor M. Belousov, a graduate of KharkovUniversity, has repeatedly criticized the autocratic-feudal order inEmpire, supported the restructuring of society based on freedom, equality andbrotherhood. Professor F. Singer discussed with students in their classroom revolutionaryevents in Europe.</span></p>

And when the disciples were silent, the professorsaid that a sovereign can be reset, to kill. It had to hear allstudents ... &quot;</span></p>

<p class="bb"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Judge</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">: <b style="">1</b>.

Then polish the rebels have put forward the famousslogan: &quot;For Your Freedom and Ours!&quot; They were counting on the union to fightagainst imperial oppression of all opposition forces from public Russian, Ukrainian,Belarusians, Lithuanians. On the Right Bank, they called on landowners at leastpromise to give land to peasants to engage them on their side, but mostPolish nobility rejected this proposal.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In support of the insurgents weregroups of Polish nobility of the Right Bank. Ukrainian peasantry believed their actionspurely &quot;business lords, and to persuade him to joinPolish nobles, slogans alone was not enough.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Russian government at first appearedin deep water, but very quickly created a way out.Chief of Russian forces, Field Marshal F.Osten-Saken addressedUkrainian peasants Right Bank. &quot;Do not believe them (ie Polish) - he called - andthose who would persuade and compel an uproar, and try to grab dopravytyauthorities.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">6. Imperial Politics in the Dnieperafter suppressing the Polish uprising</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The revolutionary events that sweptEurope, and Polish revolt 1830-1831 biennium Nicholas led and deployedstruggle against the European plague. As aptly expressed about Nicolayhe tried truncated all chairperson, who vyvyschuvalys above average level.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">History of Cossack regiments, formedLittle Russian governor-general, has ended.

Ofthose who tried to protest, dozens died in shpitsrutenamy. HimselfRepnin was dismissed.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nicholas Repnin</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"> itsLittle activity as governor-general is very remarkablefrom among the other royal officials in the Dnieper. He was of the oldprincely family Chernigov Rurik dynasty. His whole life was devoted Repnincivil and military service, has reached very high positions, but also earnedFame and liberal supporter of Ukrainian interests. The origins of the many miraclesPrince contemporaries associated with its romantic story of love and marriage withgranddaughter of the last Ukrainian hetman Kirill Razumovsky. Repnin wasnot only highly educated man, but, as evidenced by his work, and courageousdecent.</span></p>

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the period of tenureLittle Governor-General (1816-1834 biennium) he pretty much made fordevelopment of the land. Repeatedly Repninu had, on narazhayuchysirritation metropolitan bureaucracy defend Ukrainian interests beforeimperial government. He also maintained friendships with manynobles-autonomists and, as some claimed, was even a member of the PoltavaMasonic Lodge &quot;Love of Truth.&quot; Many did Repnin developmentUkrainian culture.

<p class="sm"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Repnin activity and itsconnections with the Decembrists displeased the emperor. When the &quot;supporters&quot;Governor-General wrote the denunciation and once accused him that henot dissolve established Cossack regiment, since becoming a hetman, suspiciousEmperor decided to act. Under the pretext of financial abuse (it invested its owninvestment in building in Poltava Institute of Noble girls when stateused to the end!) deposed him from office. In his final years he lived in his RepninYagotin estate, where many times visited Shevchenko. Prince treated the poetvery sympathetic, and his daughter fell in love with Barbara T. for life.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Significant changes were madeimperial government on the Right Bank. After the rebellion of the formertolerant attitude towards Poles language was not. Specially created in 1831Commission for Western provinces had by order of Nicholas I &quot;bring allwestern lands in line with the Great provinces in all fields.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Consequently, the unfoldedlarge-scale campaign of forcible Russification of the region.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Brutal repressionsubjected the Polish nobility.

On the right bank were also closed significantnumber of Catholic and Greek Catholic churches and monasteries. Ukrainianfarmers appreciated for their assistance Empire never succeeded. Though I do not blamewas for that: just promised that they no longer belong to the landowners rebels.Indeed, instead of confiscated estates, new masters -therefore, words are not broken ...</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Polish patriots attemptedresistance to imperial policy.
