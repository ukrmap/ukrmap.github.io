For a long time itprepared by the Central National Committee, which had close ties with the Polishemigration in Western Europe. The main purpose of the rebellion proclaimed competitionPoland&#39;s national independence and reform. But on the borders of the restoredPolish state and the depth of the views of social reform rebelliondiverged. Much of the leaders of the uprising, supported the restorationPoland&#39;s borders in 1772, ie the division of the Commonwealth.The uncertainty in the end, had negative consequences: the Ukrainian peasants and workersUkrainian movement did not support the rebellion.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In preparation for the uprising, its leaderspaid great attention to the Right Bank Ukraine. Here lived a significant partPolish population (485 thousand, or 9.2%), these lands once belonged to thePolish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and another uprising in Ukraine had to distract the forces of the king&#39;s troopsof the Polish uprising of their own lands. In Right-Bank Ukraine uprisingprepared the &quot;Central Committee in Russia&quot;, then &quot;Provincial Committee in Russia.The leaders of the uprising were designed: in Kiev province -V. Rudnitsky, Podolski - Yablonovsky, Volyn - E. Ruzhitsky.</span></p>

On the side of the rebels crossed the small part of soldiers and officersRussian army officials and all-revolutionary organization &quot;Earth andfreedom &quot;.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In Right-Bank Ukraine actedsome 20 guerrilla groups, which consisted mainly of representativesPolish gentry. All attempts to bring the rebels to their side of the Ukrainian peasantswere unsuccessful. Farmers sometimes even helped Russian troops againstPoles. Of the nearly 20 thousand rebels were only 500 Russians and BelarusiansUkrainian. From the Ukrainian who took part in the revolt can be calledA. Slavic languages (military organization led by &quot;Earth and will&quot;), I. Nechaya (guerrilla commanderunit, which operated in the area of Lublin) and others.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Despite heroic resistance, the uprising in1864 was suppressed.

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">7. Valuev Circular and its implications</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Revival of the Ukrainian movementat first caused no concern of Russian authorities. Publishing and Educationactivities of Ukrainian leaders positively perceived as a Russianintellectuals and government officials. But already in 1862 situation has changed dramatically.Despite the lack of romanticism and political overtones in the workhromadamen, royal officials concluded that the threat of the Ukrainian movementRussian Empire. In Ukraine, conducted arrests and exile wereP. Chubynsky ethnographer, historian P. Efimenko, S. Nose ethnographer, writerA. Rodin.

Trying toopen letter Antonovich and 20 members of the Kiev community refute thesewitness statements and their loyalty, assuring that their purpose &quot;is the only educationpeople &quot;, and&quot; talk of separatism is a stupid joke, were unsuccessful.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Changes in policy towards the Ukrainianmovements were caused by:</span></p>

<p class="spis1" style=""><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">·<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">rapidgrowing number of Ukrainian-language educational, scientific, religious literature,that, according to the censors, contributed to the revival of &quot;Little peoples&quot; and&quot;Yuzhnorusskoho separatism. Especially alarmed Russian officials emergenceUkrainian language translation of the Gospel, performed by Philip Marochevskym(1806-1879).</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In Ukraine, for investigationof Ukrainian separatism was sent Adjutant-wing MV Mezentsev. Byresults of the investigation Interior Minister P. Valuev July 20, 1863issued a secret circular, which prohibited public use of Ukrainian ingovernment offices, schools, churches, print, in Ukrainian popular scientificand religious literature than fiction, where she was regarded as exotic&quot;Dialect&quot;.

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Essence Valuev CircularProhibition was not the Ukrainian language and its use as a language of culture,Science. It can be used in a context where it sounded as exoticcommon dialect - in ethnography, folklore, literature, theater.The Ukrainian language was off the high concept to save themfor Russian culture. But barring publication of educational and religiousliterature in Ukrainian Ukrainian movement was deprived opportunitiesspread their ideas among the people and not give it to realize its identity.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Valuev circular was logicalConsidering formal policy on Ukrainian: Ukrainian is considered inorodtsyamy(Ie the local part of the colony) and the declarative partSingle Rus people that kept ethnographic and dialectic features.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Russian officials usedValuev Circular with particular enthusiasm. Thanks to the tsarist censorship,Kostomarov complained in 1871, Ukrainian literature virtually ceasedexist within the Russian Empire.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After Valuev Circularthe association was dissolved. Kyiv community wound up its work in autumn1864 The first round of community movement.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">But Ukrainian officials have not forsakenwork.
