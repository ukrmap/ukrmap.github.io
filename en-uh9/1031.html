The real explosion of protestsCossacks replied the stork, when after the Napoleonic wars and the returnin their native land were actually turned in napivkripatskyy state in the formmilitary settlements. Deceived Cossacks rose in September, 1817 underCenturion by Theodore Barvinskyi in Kherson. The Russian government on10000th with troops and guns brutally suppressed the uprising. Kazakov, whorefused to become military settlers, pricked peaks, stoked in the university,drove the &quot;green street&quot; (through the formation of soldiers, who beat the guiltyshpitsrutenamy - sticks 500-1000 times, pocketing most of the death) and sentto Siberia.

The rest of the BugCossacks were settled in the area m.Chuhuyeva in Kharkiv, where in summer 1819also ignited the uprising. After the suppression of uprisings by twoinfantry regiments were arrested around 2 thousand of its members, of whom 273 weresentenced to death. However, the founder of the military settlements O. Arakcheyev thatpersonally led the killings, &quot;repented&quot; and sentenced to death sentence replacedshpitsrutenamy punishment - to 12 thousand hits each. Some sourcesindicate that terrible death in the &quot;green street&quot; killed at least 80 peopleand the remainder transported to the hospital unconscious, but spared no one in Arakcheyevapleaded. A friend who visited those who survived the executions, in the hospital, wrote,that &quot;the only voice you can know that they were people, not a pile of meat.</span></p>
