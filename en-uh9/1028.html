<p class="bb"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Remember</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">: <b style="">1</b>. When and how the Russian government abolishedZaporizhzhya in January? <b style="">2</b>. How has fatethat stayed under the authority of the Russian Empire after the liquidation of the Sich? <b style="">3</b>. As was established Danubian Sich?What was the situation of the Cossacks in the Turkish possessions? <b style="">4</b>. What role was played by Zaporozhye Ukrainian Sich in life for her yearsexistence?</span></p>

<p class="6"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. The fate of the Cossacks in Zaporizhia <span class="SpellE">XIX</span>Art.</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Two branches of felledtree &quot;- so called historians fate after the dissolution of the Russian CossacksGovernment Zaporizhzhya Sich. One branch remained in the lands of the Russian Empire andwas forced to explore uninhabited land between the Sea of Azov and<span class="SpellE">r.Kuban</span>; Friend - found refuge in the landsTurkish sultan, which established a new Danube Delta in January. The tragedy of these detachedfrom their native land people and deepening the fact that during the constant wars betweenRussia and Turkey, they had to go brother to brother, kill Coreligioniststo someone else&#39;s business. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Russian and Ottoman empiresgladly used the Cossacks to realize their goals, but the servicedeprived sense the existence of the Cossacks. Zaporizhzhya Cossacks have always beendefenders of their native land, and this goal has inspired, to provide forces in combatenemies. Empire Service formally kept Cossacks, but deprived of his principalroles - defender of his people.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, the role of Ukrainian Cossacks<span class="SpellE">XIX</span>Art. You can not underestimate. Even in thosedifficult times and it is outside the Ukrainian lands managed to maintain culturetraditions and historical memory of its people.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Black Sea Cossack Host</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Created with Cossacks Cossacks whoremained in the Russian Empire, the Black Sea Cossack Host lived on landbetween the Southern Bug and Dniester. However, long stay in these lands it is notable. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1787-1791 biennium by CossacksEmpire in Turkey to seize the land between the Dniester and the Black Seafortresses <span class="SpellE">Kinburn</span> and Hadzhybeyem. After winningRussian government was giving away these lands, and along with them on those livingCossacks, Russian dignitaries and foreign colonists. The prospect of rotation toserfs prompted the Cossacks from the Russian government to seek permission torelocation to other places.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Empress Catherine <span class="SpellE">ІІ</span> decided to approve the request of the Cossacks. From this ithad a double benefit: pozbuvalasya Cossacks from Ukraine and due to their resettlementon the mainland to ensure the protection of borders of the empire. In 1792Black Cossack troops were relocated to the Black Sea on defensive lineright bank of the Kuban, the protection of which was the primary responsibility of the Cossacks.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At first, traditional forms of lifeCossacks remained the same as before. Main basket Black Cossacktroops, led by the military (kosh) chieftain, was located innewly <span class="SpellE">m.Katerynodari</span>. All land wasredistributed to 40 hovel, of which 38 had the same name that existed in the armyZaporizhzhya. Smoking led by Ataman Cossacks are elected. But the Cossackofficers who received orders and privileges of the Russian Army no longer wantedcontrol of its activity by the military council and the possibility of losing their posts.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Cossack officers developed andRussian government approved new rules of Cossack life. They likviduvalasyamilitary council, private property zatverdzhuvalasya officers on the ground that their earlierwas appointed over the army. Finally, it was abolished long-standing ban Cossackconcerning women. <span class="SpellE">Katerynodar</span> Sich was not as usualcity where the family lived Cossacks. </span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The duty of the Black Sea CossacksMilitary service was the empire. They defended the border area on the rightRiviera<span class="SpellE">r.Kuban</span> attacks from the mountain peoples.Cossacks Chernomortsev acted as in the Russian army in 1794, inPoland, during the Franco-Russian War in 1812 and Russian-Turkishwars.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Russian government has periodicallypereselyav here <span class="SpellE">otchayduhiv</span> Left Bank. In this way,<b style="">Empire had a double benefit: removedLeft Bank with those who might start fighting for their lost rights, andprovided a brave</b>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoHeading7"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoHeading7"><span style="font-family: Arial;">From the letter O. Prince<span class="SpellE">Baryatynskoho</span> War Minister O. Milyutinu withproposals for the reorganization of the Black Sea Cossack Host.</span></p>

<p class="it"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&quot;In the Black Sea Cossacksarmy, consisting of Little and traditions of the Zaporizhzhya Sich, theirtakes the form of identity and nationality revealed in their nepryhylnostiinorodtsiv to whom the Cossacks acidly called Moskal. M Blacktroops from the Caucasian line can counter this, but it is important that this mergerproynyalo also Cossack way of life. &quot;</span></p>

<p class="bb"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Judge</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">: <b style="">1</b>. What has caused concern anddissatisfaction with the imperial elite in the life of Cossacks Chernomortsev? <b style="">2</b>. Why imperial officials endeavored to makeBlack Sea Cossacks forget their old customs and traditions? <b style="">3</b>. Chernomorets Why preserve their own forms of the nationalLife in &quot;the era of nationalism was a danger to the empire?&quot;</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Danubian Sich</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The second part of the Zaporizhzhya Cossackswho does not want to serve the Russian Empire and tried hard to keeptheir customs, settled in the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish sultan granted themland at the mouth of the Danube, and appeared Transdanubia basket. Duty <span class="SpellE">Cossacks zadunaytsiv</span> Military service was at the Turkishfleet during military campaigns. But the prospect of battle with their brothers inblood and weapons during the Russo-Turkish wars sparked strong protestCossacks ago by order of Sultan began to use them only against the Serbs,Albanians and Greeks.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Turkish authorities have never trusted<span class="SpellE">Cossack zadunaytsyam</span> and devised a reliable methodensure their loyalty. Every time the Cossacks with TurkishArmy set out on an expedition against the Christians, the entire basket ruchavsya for them. Iftheir defiance of the Turkish commanders, those who remained on the Host, are consistent withhis life for friends. Cossack society was divided by 38 with old hovelnames. Married Cossacks lived separately, outside of the basket; Cossack chieftain, byancient tradition, every year pereobyraly Cossack general council. Eachhut had his badge or flag. Besides Cossack chieftain, was elected secretary,captain, smoking atamans. By order of the Sultan has always been to Host Turkishofficer, whose official duty was to issue passports to those who left herlimits, and unofficial - to observe the behavior of the Cossacks.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The main source of replenishmentDanusian Sich were fugitives from Dnieper Ukraine. This number<span class="SpellE">Cossacks zadunaytsiv</span>Together with families to reachsome 10 thousand years before the Turkish government against the involvement of Cossacks to suppressliberation uprisings of the Christian subjects of the empire at the beginning <span class="SpellE">XIX</span>Art. and Russian campaigns during theRusso-Turkish wars of 1806-1812 and 1828-1829 biennium prompted some <span class="SpellE">zadunaytsiv</span> to return to the land, subject to RussianEmpire.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial;">4. Return of the Cossacks from the Danubeand the creation of the Azov Cossack Host</span></h3>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During the Russo-Turkish War1806-1812 biennium Russian army again assured in military capabilities <span class="SpellE">zadunaytsiv</span>When the king&#39;s general A.<span class="SpellE">Lanzheron</span>failed 1807 overcome resistance to 3 thousand Cossacks who defended the Turkish fortress<span class="SpellE">Brailov</span>. &quot;Transdanubia <span class="SpellE">Cossacks -</span>bitterly reported <span class="SpellE">he -</span> may harmgreater than the Turks and Tatars ... &quot;Since then, the Russian command failed topidmanyuvannya <span class="SpellE">zadunaytsiv</span> all the privileges thatCossacks used to Chernomortsev <span class="SpellE">Kuban -</span> tojust bring them back.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As a result of this campaign1807 separate groups <span class="SpellE">Cossacks zadunaytsiv</span> startedmove to the side of Russia. The tsarist government immediately gave orders to their commandersRussian army officers and Cossacks of Emperor Alexander I of that yearcreated <b style="">Ust-Danube <span class="SpellE">Budzhatske</span> Cossack Host </b>&quot;Following the example of former armyZaporizhzhya.</span></p>

<p class="txt"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rumors of a &quot;new Sichon the Danube spread quickly and caused massive flight of peasants to serfsBessarabia. This frightened the king&#39;s government in the summer of that year eliminated &quot;on JanuaryDanube &quot;, and most of the Kuban Cossacks directed. However, many Cossacksrefused to move and still live in old places, leaving claimsHost renovation.</span></p>

Russian governmentguaranteed a very high Otaman work and good pay, and those who passalong with it - amnesty and freedom. However great vizier sent on Januaryorder to <span class="SpellE">zadunaytsi</span> preparing for war. ThisCossacks forced perspective to think about what to do: fight or go&quot;Brother to brother&quot; with the Orthodox, or jump to the side of the Russians. AtamanJoseph Smooth came from among nearly 13 thousand <span class="SpellE">zadunaytsiv</span>500 of its supporters and removing banners and military jewelry, moved toside of the Russians.</span></p>
