Armed conflicts, revolutions, riots, political crisis continued to shake the European continent has for several years.</p><p class="rvps2"> main root cause of acute political struggle and confrontation was in the formation of Versailles, which was the first attempt in history to achieve harmony between our countries and the world community, but it was unfair, especially to the vanquished countries.</p><p class="rvps2"> Also new European borders, carried out on the map as a result of a long diplomatic bargaining, not always take into account the will of the people of areas subject to territorial redistribution. Especially evident disparity of state borders and ethnic boundaries of the settlement reflects the map &quot;The nations of Central and Eastern Europe in the interwar period. In 1923 the majority of interstate conflict connected with the territorial problem was solved solution, some have postponed for the future. Yes, Italy in its favor solved the problem of Fiume. Went to the armed conflict with Greece on the island of Corfu, but this time unsuccessfully (1923). Poland, using any means, managed to achieve the joining of the Silesia region of Vilnius, Riga and for peace in 1921 with Soviet republics - in Western Ukraine and Western Belarus. In 1923, the new eastern border of Poland was considered the Entente countries. Remained unresolved dispute between the Soviet republics and Romania of Bessarabia.</p><p class="rvps2"> instability of the situation adding new attempts by leaders of the Comintern and Soviet Russia ignite a global revolution in Europe after the defeat of the socialist revolution in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia in 1919 Thus, during the Soviet-Polish War of 1920-1921 Red Army tried to bring their bayonets revolution in Europe. But the better-armed Polish army managed to stop the &quot;red invasion&quot;. The next attempt occurred in 1923, while in Bulgaria, Poland and Germany were also organized armed appearances driven Communist Party. But these revolts were brutally suppressed by government troops, the Communist Party suffered police harassment and lost for a long time a significant number of his supporters.</p><p class="rvps2"> war and postwar instability had a great influence on the internal political situation in Europe, even those who escaped the revolution. In England the situation was stabilized by broad social reforms. In France, social tensions could translate into a state of waiting for the moment when Germany will pay reparations. In Spain vstanovyvsya <a href="index.php?id=1334&lang=en#avtoritarizm"> authoritarian </a> mode Prima de Rivera (push to the Spanish army were defeated in war with the Republic of Rif in Morocco). Post-war problems of Italy, whom they called &quot;vanquished among the winners,&quot; resulted in &quot;red biennium&quot; (1920-1921 biennium), when the workers took power in factories vyhanyayuchy owners. Italy fell into chaos, the government was in complete inaction. In such circumstances the ruling elite scared &quot;red danger&quot; to appoint the prime minister the leader of Italy&#39;s fascist movement B. Mussolini. October 30, 1922 he led troops entered Rome blackshirt. Mussolini activelyat fashyzatsiyi took to the country and transform Italy into a powerful empire of the Mediterranean.</p><p class="rvps2"> the early 20&#39;s in the leading countries of the Entente to power who did not want to pin responsibility for the injustice of Versailles, at the same time trying to improve it. As a result, the 20-ties was a series of measures to remedy the defects of post-war settlement in Europe.</p><p class="rvps2"> One of the weaknesses of the new system was the exclusion of her Russia. Trying to isolate Russia because of the commitment of its leaders to the idea of world revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat had no success, but has made a destructive element in international relations. In the early 20-ies became clear that the Bolsheviks were firmly established in power, and plans for world revolution - impracticable. In 1922, Russia invited the delegation to the Genoa conference on the search of &quot;economic recovery of Central and Eastern Europe, where, among other issues, an attempt was made to develop common terms for normalizing relations with Soviet Russia and other Soviet republics. But problems paying debts royal party could not overcome. Entente countries put in by $ 18 billion rubles. In response to Soviet Russia demanded that it pay 39 billion rubles. for losses from intervention of the Entente. In addition, the delegation of Soviet Russia flatly refused to pay the debts of the Provisional Government.</p><p class="rvps2"> Appearing at a conference in critical condition, April 16, 1922 Soviet Russia and Germany in the town of Rapallo signed an agreement to restore diplomatic relations in full and to refuse any claims. This agreement initiated fruitful cooperation between Russia and Germany in economic, political and military spheres. Under this agreement Russia Germany forgave her debt -10,000,000,000 rubles. The contract was a breakthrough on the diplomatic front, which brought Russia and Germany from international isolation. Treaty of Rapallo has created a fundamentally new situation in Europe. Two &quot;insulted&quot; the state made a contract, effectively jeopardizing elaborated winners post-war security system. The one that saved the Versailles system was that Germany remained weak conditions of peace, and Russia - Revolution and civil war.</p><p class="rvps2"> In 1924 rolling wave of diplomatic recognitions from other Western countries who were concerned about the possibility of establishing a strong German-Soviet bloc antyversalskoho. Exceptions were only the United States. But relations between the West and the USSR were unequal. The Soviet Union tried removing the solution for European Affairs, to isolate it, a country that had a common border with it, &quot;sanitary zone&quot;. This resulted in mistrust of the Soviet leadership in the West and contributed to even greater rapprochement of Russia with Germany and Turkey.</p><p class="rvps2"> same time it was faster solution of problems connected with fulfillment of the Treaty of Versailles and restore Germany to the world community as a full member.</p><p class="rvps2"> remained most acute issue of reparations. Established in 1921 amount (123 billion marks) was not capable of Germany. France is demanding full payment and to make the Germany before, along with Belgium occupied the Ruhr region, where heavy industry was concentrated in Germany (1923).</p><p class="rvps2"> An international crisis. To solve the difficult situation in London in 1924 an international conference was convened, which adopted a plan developed by the commission of experts led by American banker Dauesa. According to the plan envisaged the withdrawal of French and Belgian troops from the Ruhr and Germany commit yazuvalasya in the next 4 years to pay 1-1,75 billion marks a year and in subsequent years - to 2 billion of 6 years of this plan, Germany has paid in July , 5 billion marks. The plan involved the provision of German and American English credits in the amount of $ 2 billion. How to guarantee implementation of the plan installed allied control of the railways and the State Bank of Germany. The implementation plan Dauesa helped restore the German economy, but put it in dependence on the U.S..</p><p class="rvps2"> In 1929, they adopted a new plan for American businessmen and bankers Jung, followed by reparations volume decreased to 113.9 billion marks, and annual payments were established in the amount of 2.5 billion marks. The payments were spread for 55 years. According to the plan all types of control over Germany and its economy and finances were canceled. To receive reparations and their distribution was established Bank for International Settlements. The bank played a leading role in financing the leading sectors of German economy and helped to further ownership ed Germany to the economy in the U.S..</p>
