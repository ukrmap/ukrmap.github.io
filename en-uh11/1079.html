<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">1. <span style="">Radnarhospyand their impact on economic development of Ukraine</span></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Zalikuvavshy terrible wounds of warlifting of<i><span style="text-transform: uppercase;"> </span></i>ruins people&#39;seconomy. Soviet people have created the necessary conditions for further developmenteconomy on a scale that exceeded pre-war.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Significant place in this process has taken XXCongress of the CPSU, which was proclaimed <b style="">programclay creation of the national economy</b>That he had to cover all linkssocial production, distribution and exchange across the country.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Important factors of thiseconomic program were considered, continuous technological progress, rapidproductivity growth and continued development of all industries,increasing material and cultural living standards of people.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Expected that implementation of thisprogram will provide the main economic problem solving USSR </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> inhistorically brief period to catch up and overtake the most economically developedcountries.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">50 years, especially its second half,were <b style="">most successful in developingNational Economy</b> such as the Soviet Ukraine and the USSR as a whole.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Among<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>economic<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Khrushchev reformsknown and most controversial was a radical <b style="">decentralization of industry</b>. In accordance with herFebruary 1957 was liquidated most ministries, and insteadThey established territorial council of national economy </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">– <i><span style="color: black;">radnarhospy.</span></i><span style="color: black;">As a result, was reduced in 1910union and 15 union-republican ministries.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Instead, it was established 103radnarhospy, including 11 </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> in Ukraine. They were united by 2,8 thousandcompanies that produced most of the industrial production of the republic.The largest in Ukraine were Kyiv, Kharkiv and Lviv radnarhospy.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">With the establishment of new bodiesagricultural management of the local political elite for the first time receivedable to keep under its own control the development of economic potentialRepublic, which will surely greatly strengthened its political position.Economic innovations especially increased authority and influence of the secretaries of the regional committees inhands which were concentrated the main levers of government established radnarhospamy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">It is clear that party leadersareas where radnarhospiv was not trying to create them in their regions. AsConsequently, in 1960 Republic was formed in an additional three newCouncil of National Economy </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> <i>Crimean, Poltava and Cherkassy.</i></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Implementing radical economictransformation, Nikita Khrushchev expected more for their political implications. Reformindustry management, strengthening the position of local business executives, while weakenedof the Moscow bureaucracy. These conservative forces immediately felt thatlose control over the economy. No coincidence that a month afteradoption of the decentralization of management was an attemptcoup in the USSR.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Having full replacement industryterritorial management industry, Nikita Khrushchev was able to do the followingReformation step </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> Move on economiccalculation. This was necessary to introduce a new economic mechanism,which aimed to provide maximum independence of enterprises and acceleratematerial motivation of workers. But this important step towards reform Nikita Khrushchevdid not dare. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But the economic consequences of reform fornational economy as a whole were disappointing. Planned economycould not effectively act on directives from different centers. Sonaturally, that several years had to return tocentralized management.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">This was initially duea central radnarhospiv in the top three republics - <i>RussiaUkraine and Kazakhstan, </i>As a result of radnarhospiv in Ukrainedecreased to 7 and then there was only one union and leading economic center </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> Councilof the USSR. She has plans to monitor complianceIndustry Development radnarhospiv all republics.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Such outright retreat from economicreforms resulted in the formation in 1963 High Council of National EconomyUSSR, which included duty in all leadership bodies of the Peoplehouseholds.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">2. </span></b><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Development <span style="color: black;">Industry</span></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Despite the endless organizationalchanges in management of the national economy, the economy of the republic during theKhrushchev generally well developed. The pace of industry development in Ukraine <b style="">exceeded the average for the Soviet Union</b>.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In Ukraine, was erected anumber of large thermal and <b style="">Hydropower</b>
<i>(Simferopol, Slavic, Dneprodzerzhinsk, TL, Kremenchug andetc.).. </i>In the republic had mastered <b style="">newminefield</b> <i>(Lviv-Volyn and the Kiev), </i>Gasdeposits on <i>Poltava and Kharkiv.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">All this enabled the level of Ukraineproduction of steel products per capita ahead <span class="SpellE">highly developed</span> countries. However, we must admit that atthe quality of the metal remained low.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">A huge amount of work was done atthe development of chemical industry. In 1959-1963 he in Ukrainewas built 35 new plants and more than 250 large chemical plants.Rapidly evolved during this period <i>Lisichanskiy and <span class="SpellE">RUBEZHNOYE</span>chemical plant, <span class="SpellE">Gorlovka</span> <span class="SpellE">azotnotukovyy</span>plant. </i>Were built and given the production four giants &quot;great chemistry&quot; </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> <span class="SpellE"><i>Rosdolsky</i></span><i> Mining and Chemical Plant.Cherkassy and Chernigov fabricated fibers, Dnepropetrovsk Tireplant. </i>In the mid 60&#39;s they gave one fifth of the grossproducts industry.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Some achievements in the years Khrushchevreforms have occurred in mechanical engineering. During that time, was actually createddomestic automotive and manufacturing of modern machinery formining industry, allowing us to economically produceminerals open.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Since 1956 in <i>Vorosilovgrad </i>(Now</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> Luhansk) and <i>Kharkiv </i>started to producelocomotives, which enabled locomotives to stop production and switch to diesel locomotivesElektrovozna and traction.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In Kharkiv aviation wasadjusted scale production the world&#39;s first high-speed turbojet<b style="">Tu-104</b>. In turn, KyivAircraft began to produce turboprop airliner <span class="SpellE"><b style="">Ан</b></span><b style="">-24</b>. which is widely used in air vnutrishnosoyuznyhroutes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Had been noticed some positiveand changes in the traditionally backward areas of the economy </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;">food and light industry.

Interestingly, in these yearsenterprises of heavy industry for the first time in Soviet times, specially createdplants started production <b style="">catalogConsumer Goods</b>That largely contributed to the growth of national wealth.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The most noticeable for ordinary citizensthere are always changes taking place in agriculture. Realizing thatagricultural sectors is most criticalcondition, Nikita Khrushchev sought at any price just to get here fast positiveresults.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">According to the then leaders,such progress in agriculture could be achieved thanks to the developmentvirgin and fallow lands <i>Kazakhstan, Siberia, Volga region. Ural andNorth Caucasus.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Pioneering was announcedKomsomol honorable thing for a trip to Kazakhstan for a permanent jobin 1954-1956 he Ukraine has been sent to nearly 80 thousand boys and girls.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ukrainian migrants in developedKazakh walls work 54 state farms.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The largest harvest in the virgin lands gave1956, when they were collected half of the state harvest bread.But the extremely weak spot virgin policy was huge lossesgrain production, which eventually turned out 20% more expensive thanaverage.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Another important means of raisingAgriculture Nikita Khrushchev believed to increase cultivation of corn. Byhuge and even excessive persistence in fighting for the expansion of crops&quot;Queen Field&quot; Nikita Khrushchev was popularly nicknamed <i>«<span class="SpellE">Nikita-kukurudzyanyk</span>».</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Business as agriculturalleader Nikita Khrushchev for his determined attitude to growing corn,increase its yield set in direct dependence on the level of political awarenessmanufacturers. &quot;When some parts of the country&#39;s maize is introduced formally,collective and state farms receive low yields, then the blame for the climate, andleaders </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> said Nikita Khrushchev at the XXII Congress of the CPSU. </span>–<span style="color: black;"> Where corn is born, is a &quot;component&quot; that is notcontributes to its growth. This &quot;component&quot; should look in the manual ... Should be replacedthose employees who themselves withered and dried culture such as corn, notgive it an opportunity to deploy the power.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Attempts pryzvychayity UkrainianIndustry borrowed this culture in America is crowned only minorsuccess. In 1961, were collected a good harvest of corn. But in 1963due to drought was very barren a whole. To remove the sharpproblem of shortage of bread were baked bread, which had a significant impuritycorn flour. Because of its specific taste, he did not like the population,and eat it just because the other was not. That same year the Soviet Union <i>first timebegan to purchase and import grain from abroad.</i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><img src="/images/uh11b/uh11_13_files/image004.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_s1026" align="left" height="195" hspace="12" width="239"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">&quot;Corn epic&quot;showed that <b style="">Khrushchev&#39;s agricultural policyoften do not take into account the objective conditions and real possibilities</b> Agriculturalproduction of different regions.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">If from 1950 to 1958gross agricultural production of Ukraine increased by 65%, then <span style="">в<i> </i></span>1958-1964 biennium </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> only3%. This, of course, adversely affected the social policies of Ukrainewhich Nikita Khrushchev, should pay tribute, paid much attention.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Consistently strengthening collective farms andstate farms, while Nikita Khrushchev launched a decisive attack on the individual peasanteconomy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In 1955 was takenorder to reduce by half the size of household plots, and in 1959</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> banning keep livestock in urban and suburbanzone. This is further complicated an already difficult food situation, assmall but very effective Farming has always been extremelyimportant source of supply of agricultural products to the public.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Failure to reform agricultureeconomy has led to serious disorder in the relations between the Ukrainianleadership and N. Khrushchev.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Considering himself a great connoisseurAgriculture, Nikita Khrushchev constantly rebuked by the leaders of the republiclack of commercial interest to the village, inability to manageagriculture. Such criticism is sometimes led to sharpclashes between <i>N. Khrushchev </i>і <i>М.<span class="SpellE">Piedmont</span>. </i>AndStill, wanting to avoid conflict, the Ukrainian party was able to quickly tiprebuild and skillfully reported on high yields, which often were notbarn, but only on paper. As a rule, went to Moscow reports on the successful implementationand over-laid on a republic targets.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">However, Ukrainian leaders felt thatlost their concern and support from Khrushchev. In turn, the formerdedication and commitment towards a <i>з </i>by Republicantop stopped noticing and Nikita Khrushchev.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">4. The level of living. Statefood and commodity support</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Undoubtedly, the most important outcomeeconomic reforms of Khrushchev was stirring social policy, which coveredalmost all aspects of life of the population. According to experts, this trendof Khrushchev near elimination of the infamous <span class="SpellE">Gulag</span>
(</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;" lang="RU">General Directorateyspravytelno of labor-camp</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;" lang="RU"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">–<span style="color: black;"> Main Departmentlabor camps) was truly historic in its meaning.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">To have the support of workers inagainst their political opponents, Nikita Khrushchev tried to &quot;push&quot;first of all, the most popular and quite necessary for ordinary people measures.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In particular, in the first years of hisguidance was reduced working hours for teenagers andperedvyhidni and holiday days, extended leave for pregnant womenabolished tuition fees and abolished the strict law that effectively securedworkers for enterprises, not giving them opportunity to leave and go to the other. Thesedecisions Nikita Khrushchev once won the sympathy and support of wide sectionspopulation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Moreover, the time Khrushchev wasmade real <b style="">&quot;Pension Revolution</b>,which simultaneously reduced the retirement age limit and increased pensions. Averagesalary for the 1953-1965 biennium in workers and employees increased bythird, a minimum </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">– <span style="color: black;">from 27 to 45 rubles.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In 1957 were finally <b style="">eliminated</b> <b style="">regular government loans</b>That existed in the form of distributionbonds. They actually took 10% salary workers and served mediumindirect taxation of workers. But the payment of debt by the populationacquired bonds delayed for 20 years.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Certain positive changes have been made andin the village. Among the most important events should be called <b style="">harvesting increase prices</b> for agricultural products thatimmediately gave an impetus to productivity growth in agricultureeconomy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Spring 1953 of collectivefarms <b style="">written off the entirearrears</b> past years to supply animal products.

In March 1956 wasdecided on a monthly advance rural workers and an additional chargework in collective farms.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Consequently, in 1958 Moneyadvancing funds to have more than 80% of the agricultural andMore than 500 farms have introduced a guaranteed payment of labor days. This year the count hospnykyUkraine finally <b style="">received</b> <b style="">Passports</b>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In line 3 of the Resolution of the CC CPSU andUSSR Council of Ministers <i><span style="">On developmentHousing </span>construction in the USSR &quot; </i>(July 1957) belongedtask of every Soviet family separate apartments.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">To do this in every major citycreated high-performance plant. forces in their cities andvillages <span style="">Ukraine by<b> </b></span>10years has built more than 3 million apartments. Although these houses p&#39;yatypoverhovilater became the name of the people humiliating &quot;hruschoby, their construction significantlytriggered from the solution <span style="">acute </span>housing-winningproblem.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Summer 1953 in the USSR byKhrushchev initiated Bull <span style="">Adopted </span><i>specialprogram of light and food industry </i>who created the preconditionsto display areas of crisis.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In Ukraine, the implementation of this plan wasfast enough to give positive results: increased markedly in storesproducts, began purchasing some goods abroad. In many families thereproducts, which could not even dream of Stalin&#39;s day: TVstape recorders, refrigerators, washing machines.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The first success in rural developmenteconomy enabled people to increase the range of food.Earlier, the average Soviet family ration is usually consisted of the followingbasic products like bread and potatoes, then the times of Khrushchev, he has grown tomore or less regular consumption of vegetables and meat in the stores were evensuch exotic delicacies for those times as citrus.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But after the reforms in agricultureeconomy exhausted, Ukraine all have extremely sharpfood problem. Particularly, it increased after the drought in 1963, whenthere were serious shortages of bread and meat and dairy products, and sharplyincreased foam on basic food. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">These negative phenomena caused candidLabor discontent <span style="">leadership </span>countryresulting Nikita Khrushchev quickly lost credibility and still won the supportpeople.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Evaluating the economic policies of Khrushchev,should be noted that beside the absolute positive shifts that have been achievedcarried out its economic and social changes often marked by conspicuoushaste, neprodumanistyu and inconsistency. His<b> </b>boldlybelief that <i>&quot;We are two to three years will solve any problem, </i>waswinged phrase that has entered almost every report or its performance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 35.4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Hruschovska decade was a periodconstant propaganda promises, most of which, unfortunately, andremained on paper. As an example populist appeal &quot;incoming years &quot;to catch up and overtake the U.S. for the production of meat, butter andmilk per capita or the program of construction for 20 years of logisticsbase of communism. All this eventually became the basis for serious allegations of Khrushchevin <i>&quot;Voluntarism and subjectivism.</i></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
