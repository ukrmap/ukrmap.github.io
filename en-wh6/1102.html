<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">In Neolithic times, mankind has madehuge step forward in its development. During this time, developed agriculture andcattle. Food and handicraft products in those placesEarth, where they had a favorable climate and fertile land, has reached such a number thatgranted the possibility to feed more people. The emergence of crafts - pottery andWeaving - gave new signs of life of primitive man. Further developmentneed of increasing the number of different implements. Stone, asmaterial for manufacturing, no longer satisfy the new needs of humanity. And thenman began to look for, what to replace it. The natural material that had otherproperties than stone, wood, bone, has been copper. In primitive times itoccurrence on the ground in pure form. The period when he learnedhandle and use copper, called copper-stone age, or <b>Bronze Age(V</b>–<b>IV thousand BC). </b>At first, people tried to handlecopper as well as stone - beat. Shock piece of copper is rozkolyuvavsya andonly changed form. After primitive man realized that copper should notbeat and beat. Forge metal began about 7 thousand BC</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">Nearly 2 thousand years untilpeople learned to smelt copper from ore. First metal vyplavlyaly in those furnaces inwhich burnt pottery. Later they built a special long steelfurnace. It is unlikely that the transition from ductile to melting was accidental, since copper mayrozplavylas was required temperature is 700-800 C °. Afterwards she startedsmelt from ore. In nature copper ores in combination with small stones lookbluish color. Ancient metallurgy could put up a stone ovenand see that most of the stone disappeared, and he got in pure copperform. Perhaps, as the man opened the way extraction of copper from ore. Scientistsbelieve that in this way the metal began to receive in different places almostsimultaneously. About vyplavlyannya copper ore evidence found by archaeologists in the ancientmines tools - Kyle of horn, copper axes and so on.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">У <span style="">III </span>BC ancient metallurgists, probably in an attempt to copperstrength, adding to her various additives until the notice that it is strongerbecomes with the addition of another metal - tin. Alloy of copper and tin is called bronze.It was valuable property that it is easier than copper, removed into shape.Thus began <b>Bronze Age </b><b style="">(III</b>–<b>PreBC).</b></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">In the II millennium BC was inventedvyplavlyannya way of iron ore.

The need for copper andbronze ware has steadily increased, thus increasing demand for people who couldprocessed metals.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">In Eneolithic was another weightychange in human life - separated from cattle farming. Scientistscalled this process <b>first social division of labor. </b>That is, some tribeswere only cattle. First they pastured cattle near their settlements, andwith the increase of the number moved in search of new pastures. Thus conditionsmanagement led to another tribal herdsmen lifestyle - nomadic.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">Farmers, by contrast, hadstay fertile land, to lead sedentary lives. Cattle, they were kept inhis house, gave them meat, milk, hides, wool. Over 5 thousandyears ago, farmers have learned to harness the cattle in ralo, and thenplow for plowing fields. This facilitated the work, accelerated and improved cultivationland, increased yields.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">Invention in the Bronze Age was the wheelanother step towards perfection and complication of implements and devices thatfacilitate human life. Carts, put on wheels, helping farmersLOAD and herders travel long distances. However, complicationstools, metalworking and crafts demanded rapid development of humanmore knowledge, skill, and experience. Among farmers and ranchersvyokremlyuvalysya masters who were only craft.

In theserefuges and the war was mixing of tribes and genera. Now in onevillage lived not only relatives but also people who did not belong to this genus, but wereonly neighbors. It formed <b>neighboring communities, </b>whose members were not relatives,but together owned land, distributing it among individual families togetherused pastures, forests and other resources, jointly decidingmost important kind of case.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">Unlike tribal communities inNeighbours certainty shall private property - property family or individualrights in tangible assets.

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">Employment in agriculture has become more difficult andcomplex and was based mostly on the shoulders of men. Gradually, and Power in kind andtribes moved to the man - a father who was headed kind. Such a systemscientists call <b>Patriarchate </b>which translated from Greek means&quot;Parent power&quot;. Patriarch was the elder, who led a common cause -construction of canals, sanctuaries and worship of deities. In his handsfocused much of the products manufactured communities, which he rozporyadzhavsya.Power eventually began to share in inheritance, and status in the tribe was determinedfamily ties with elders.

Signs thatancient society acquired the new, higher level of development were: the emergence of citiesformations, stratification, a certain level of culture.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">The transition to civilization occurred infavorable for farming and cattle breeding parts of our planet.

This fertile valley of the rivers Nile, Euphrates and Tigris, Indus and Ganges,Yellow River and Yangtze.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">In these areas there firstcity.

In these settlements, except for farmers,cattle farmers, artisans, elders focused, priests, military leaders.The settlement was surrounded by fortifications - moats, ramparts, a palisade, and evenbrick or stone walls.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">The city already had a clear division: in hiscenter housed the shrine dedicated to the gods, houses the richestresidents around - housing ordinary congregation, artisans workshops.

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent: 35.45pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="UK">The old city, remains of which archaeologistsexcavated in a hill-Chatal Huyuk, existed in the Neolithic period, more than 9 thousandyears ago. It was an area of 13 hectares, it lived from 2 to6 thousand persons.
