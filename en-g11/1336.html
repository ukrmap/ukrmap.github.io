<p><strong>Population distribution</strong> - The result of spatialdistribution of the population in the world in a certain historical period. World population is very unevenly placed, because humanity has longconcentrated in areas with favorable for farmingconditions. Because almost 70% of the world&#39;s population is only 7% of theland. About 15% of the land have no permanent population. Itareas that are characterized by extreme natural conditions -different types of deserts, forests, highlands, mainland Antarctica.</p>

<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Population distribution</strong></p> 


<p>An important feature of population distribution is <strong>average population density </strong>- degree POPULATIONS specific territory or the number of permanentpopulation per unit area (usually 1 km2).</p>
<p>The average population density of the Earth - 45 osib/km2, but there are countries andarea where the figure exceeds 300 osib/km2. The highest densitypopulation typical of coastal areas and for areas withhistorically caused by high population density. These areas are located in South East, South and South-West Asia (average density400? Osib/km2 600) Western Europe (200? Osib/km2 600), on the easterncoast of South America (100? osib/km2 200). Among the leaders of thepopulation density with large areas of the country - Bangladesh (965 osib/km2) South Korea (483 osib/km2), Netherlands (465 osib/km2), India (341osib/km2), Belgium (335 osib/km2). Among small-area countriesrecord for the population density is Maldives (1 000osib/km2), Malta (1200 osib/km2), Singapore (6000 osib/km2), Monaco(16 000 osib/km2), Macau (China) (27 000 osib/km2).</p>
<p>On the other hand half of the inhabited land is population densityabout 5 osib/km2, and Greenland, which belongs of Denmark, 1 personaccounted for 35 km2.</p>
<p><strong>Resettlement of the Population </strong>- The process of redistributing the population in a particular area, resulting in net settlements there.</p>
<p>For each epoch according to the level of economic developmentcharacteristic features of their resettlement. At the dawn of human developmentsettlement was dispersed, sometimes - nomadic. Rural Studieseconomy contributed settled, a network of settlements - rural andurban, with significant predominance of rural population.</p>

<p>In the industrial and postindustrial society dominated by urbanpopulation. It should be gradually erased the differences between rural and urbandue to the spread of urban lifestyle in the countryside - <strong>rurbanizatsiyi</strong>.</p>
<p>At the moment there are <strong>two main forms of resettlement of the population - rural and urban.</strong>In the cities lived 47% of the Earth and this share is growing.The historical process of increasing the role of cities in society, widespreadspread of urban lifestyles and urban culture called <strong>urbanization</strong>. In the narrow sense of urbanization - is the increase in cities, especiallylarge, increasing the number of residents in a particular area. Mainindicators of urbanization - the pace, level, form. <strong>Rate of urbanization </strong>shows the speed of this process in the world as a whole and its individual parts, and <strong>level of urbanization </strong>- The proportion of people living in cities.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Urbanization</strong></p>


<p>Today the urban population growth averaged 2% per year. For developed countries, characterized by a significant proportionurban population (70%) it is 0,3% per year. In countries thatdeveloping urbanization rates are much higher - 4% per year. Especially theyhigh in Western Africa and South Asia (8-13% per year),caused a small proportion of urban population and high ratespopulation growth.</p>
<p>In many urban areas all over the world can be divided intotwo groups: with the number above and far below the world averageindex. In Europe, Latin America, United States, Canada, Australia andOceania urban population is? population, and in Asia and Africa - 1 / 3.In general, higher proportion of urban population is typical for developedcountries and countries where natural conditions are not conducive to conductingAgriculture (Singapore - 100% Belgium - 97%, Kuwait - 97%, Iceland - 92%, Israel - 92%, Uruguay - 91%, UK - 91 %, Netherlands - 89%, Argentina - 89%, Germany - 88%, Libya - 88%).</p>
<p>The lowest proportion of urban population typical of the poorest countriesAfrica and Asia with the agricultural economy (Bhutan, Rwanda - 6%, Burundi - 8%, Nepal - 10%, Uganda - 13%).</p>
<p>The main form of urbanization is <strong>city. City</strong> -settlement, which screened in accordance with the law of the State tocategory of cities with certain populations that perform specific functions -administrative and political, industrial, transportation, cultural.</p>
<p>In a significant indicator of population and population density for the citycharacteristic of employment is in agriculture, specific building a compact and high accomplishment. In Japan, considercity areas with populations over 50 thousand people in the Netherlands - 20thousand people in Ukraine and Russia - 12 thousand people in the USA - 2,5 thousand, inIceland - a total of 200 people. According to statistics, UN - 20 thousand people.</p>

<p>In urbanization of traditionally allocated <strong>three &quot;waves&quot;</strong>: Middle Ages (XIV-XV cent.) Nineteenth century. (Epoch of the Industrial Revolution) andsecond half of the twentieth century. Each of the waves associated with qualitative changes inEconomics: development of manufactory and trade, industry,non-production sphere.</p>
<p>For typical modern urbanization <strong>hiperurbanizatsiya</strong>, concentration of population in large cities with populations over 1 million people.Most major cities in China (50) USA (45), India (23), Brazil(16), Russia (13). These same countries are the leaders in numberurban population. In the world there are also 23 supermista &quot;withpopulation exceeding 10 million people, most of which are in developing countries.</p>
<p>For contemporary urbanization is characterized as the growth of suburbs - <strong>suburbanizatsiya</strong>That leads to formation <strong>urban agglomerations</strong>.</p>
<p>As a result of merger agglomeration form <strong>megapolises or megalopolis</strong> (From the Greek. Megalu - big and polis - city) - solid strip of urban settlement.</p>
<p>In the United States emit megalopolis in which live more than 1 / 2 peoplecountry: Pryatlantychnyy, or your boss, &quot;(Boston - Washington DC) - 60 millionpersons, lakeside, or Chipitts &quot;(Chicago - Detroit - Pittsburgh) - 40 millionpersons; California, or &quot;San San&quot; (San Francisco - San Diego) - 25million people; Shidnoflorydskyy (Miami - West Palm Beach) and Prymeksykanskyy(Houston - New Orleans). The last two are in the megalopolisformative stage, the number of inhabitants in them is about 10 millionpersons.In Japan, the megalopolis formed Tokkay (Tokyo - Nagoya - Osaka) withpopulation over 55 million people (about half the population iscountry).</p>

<p>Record number of people became European megalopolis -about 100 million people, or almost 1 / 4 the population of Europe (excluding CIS).European megalopolis - is a giant cluster of cities and urbanagglomerations are located in many countries. It originates inManchester (UK) and ends in Milan (Italy). Between thesecities he passes through London and Birmingham (UK)Ranstad agglomeration (Amsterdam - The Hague - Rotterdam) in the Netherlands,Brussels in Belgium, the agglomeration of Lille - Roubaix - Turken and Paris in France Ruhr area, Cologne, Frankfurt am Main and Mannheim in Germany,Basel and Zurich in Switzerland. After a form (at first hestretches from northwest to southeast, then turnssouthwest) was named the &quot;European banana&quot;.</p>
<p>For many developing countries, characterized <strong>false urbanization </strong>(Pseudo urbanization), when the increase in urban populationaccompanied by a proliferation of urban lifestyle and culture, andformed <strong>urban slums</strong>Without adequate improvement.</p>
<p>Despite the urbanization of the Earth, about half the residents live in <strong>rural settlements</strong>. Particularly high proportion of rural population in Asia - 65%, Africa - 70%. In China and India, the share of rural population isrespectively 70 and 73%. Leads in this tropical country indexAfrica (Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda) and South Asia (Bhutan, Nepal).</p>

<p>Depending on natural conditions and historical traditions of the country produce <strong>group (rural) and dispersed or scattered</strong> (Hamlet, farm), form the settlement.</p>
<p><strong>A generic form</strong> settlement prevails in Europe, Japan, China, in most developing countries.</p>
<p><strong>Dispersed form </strong>prevalent in the U.S., Canada, Australia -geographically large countries with low population density and small proportion of rural residents.</p>
<p>For areas with arid climate and mountainous areas (North Africa, the northern part of West Africa, South West and Central Asia) is typical <strong>nomadic form of resettlement</strong>. The number of nomads in the world is 25-30 million people.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical movement of population</strong>. Significant impact on the world&#39;s population are placing <strong>Migration (mechanical movement of the population)</strong>- Movement of people across borders of certain areas to changelocation or on more or less long period. Migration of existing always, thanks to them accustomed new territory.</p>
<p>Migration processes in the world under influence of various factors. With this in mind distinguish several groups of migration.</p>
<p>By Area emit <strong>external migration</strong> (Crossing national borders), which share the emigration (exit from the country) and <strong>Immigration</strong> (Entrance) and <strong>internal </strong>(Within the country). Number of foreign workers up to several tens of millions a year.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>External migration</strong></p>
 


<p>By way of today is dominated by <strong>voluntary migration</strong>But numerous examples are known <strong>forced</strong>Including removal of blacks slaves from Africa to America. By way of them can be divided into <strong>organized</strong>Undertaken with government and NGOs for their organizational and economic support and <strong>unorganized </strong>- At the expense of the migrants directly without financial and logistical support to the party.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Refugees</strong></p>



<p>Reasons (motives) moving to a new residence can be varied. The most massive of them - <strong>socio-economic</strong>That express the human desire to find any paid job or</p>
<p>It is moving from developing countries with significant human resources,developed countries move leading scientists, the intellectual eliteto the U.S., Japan, Germany - &quot;brain drain&quot;. Emigrants of 23% amongMembers of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA and 33% among the winnersNobel Prize, who represented the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Political</strong> migration following the collapse of states, repression, persecution, they can be combined with <strong>war</strong> - Refugees are leaving the place of military action. Often causes find new habitats are <strong>religious</strong>conflicts such as between India and Pakistan, Bangladesh, Israel andPalestine. Sometimes representatives of certain nationalities migrated (<strong>national migration</strong>) through the repatriation process, the formation of a new national populationStates, for example, Israel and others. Often the causes of migration areunification or disintegration of the family - <strong>domestic household </strong>migration.</p> 
<p>One of the most important characteristics is <strong>duration of migration. </strong>Over a period of migration to share <strong>permanent and temporary</strong>. Temporary migration due to work-people. There are three types of temporary migration: <strong>seasonal </strong>(Related to agricultural activities - harvesting, cattle races to new pastures), <strong>crew</strong> (Related to the extraction of natural resources in poor areas for permanent residence) <strong>Pendulum</strong> (Common in areas, while suburbs in the morning with people coming to work and coming home at night).</p>
<p>Statistically, at the beginning of. in the world, there were 25 millionrefugees, including 3 / 4 was on the countries of Asia and Africa and developing countries.</p>
<p>At the beginning of. flow of international migration exceeded 150 millionpersons, the annual growth rate of migrants is 2,5%. Ontoday are three main areas attractive to migrants.
