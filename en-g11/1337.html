Of all the regions outnumberedmale population, most evident in Asia, particularlyChina and India as well as in several Muslim countries, the leadersamong which are UAE, Kuwait, Qatar.

<p>Ethnic groups do not exist continuously in time, they emerge, develop,decay and disappear. Each ethnic group closely related to naturalterms of its territory and residence. By processing in humancommon - the nation any human group is the integrationprocess in several stages: the family - tribe - nation - a nation. Tribesemerged during the first stages of human development. Main feature of the tribe that all its members - relatives. Today tribes have preservedmainly in remote areas of developing countries in Asia,Africa, Latin America and the relics of the indigenous population in some developed countries (U.S., Indians, Aborigines of Australia). Nationality ofnow call ethnic groups that are under formation indeveloping countries. Nation in the Middle Ages arose in the eraformation of centralized states and is the dominant form of ethnicity. To form a nation must have a state, the economic community, state language and national identity.</p>
<p>Concept <strong>&quot;The people&quot;</strong> used to denote peopleone country, regardless of their ethnic origin.
