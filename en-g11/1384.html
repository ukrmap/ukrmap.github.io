Comingneighboring countries are China, South Korea and Russia. The latter countryhas the largest territorial claims on the so-called &quot;NorthernTerritories &quot;, which Japan considers its (Kunashir, Iturup, Shikotan andisland ridge Habomai).</p>
<p><strong>Relief</strong> mostly mountainous country with the presence ofnumerous operating (60) and extinct volcanoes. High Point - Fujiyama Volcanoon the island. Honshu (3776 m). The processes of mountain building continues today,why earthquakes happen here from a half to eight thousand times a year.All modern buildings are built on protyseysmichniy basis. Pacificcoast affected by the tsunami height from 30 to 50 m. The climate oftemperate in the north to tropical monsoonal in the south. AverageJanuary temperatures - from-50C on the island. Hokkaido to 160p - the archipelagoRyukyu, July - respectively from 22 to 280p. Precipitation in most ofcountry - from 1700 - 2000 to 4000 mm per year, usually in autumn aretyphoons. In areas of volcanic activity are the hot springs. Japanbelongs to the world that is almost completely mastered their landresources.</p>
<p><strong>Rivers</strong> short but bahatovodni unsuitable forshipping. They are used for the construction of hydropower and water supply.Over 2 / 3 of the territory covered by forests (of evergreen conifers insubtropical) and shrubs, but the need for wood they cover only 50%.</p>
<p>Nadra country&#39;s poor. For example, the oil produced per year less than inU.S. per day, the need for iron ore, lead, zinc own resourcesprovide only 1 - 2% of the necessary requirements, because of this countrytotally dependent on imported mineral raw materials.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Economic map</strong></p> 


<p><strong>Economy</strong>. The composition of GDP cranes agriculture gives 1.4% of the cost, industry - 26.4%, services - 72.2% in value.</p>
<p>Japan is the Asian leader in terms of GDP per capita - 38,000$, Ranks first in the world in terms of gold reserves (521$ billion), third place (after USA and China) - the production of industrial and fifth - the production of agricultural products. Forthe last decade the country has sustained a positive balance of foreigntrade. Japan entered the post-industrial stage of development, significantshare of GDP is income from the service sector, health, science,financial and commercial activities and communications.</p>
<p>Japan has two acute problems: a huge government debt, which amount is 170% of GDP, and an aging population (demographic projectionsnecessarily bad for the country if the situation in the country will not change, thenbefore the next century the number will decrease by half Japanese)slowly changing the mentality of the Japanese: the stereotype of &quot;workaholic&quot;gradually changes to the stereotype of &quot;a person who works for moneyprovide him a comfortable life. &quot; Also in the country continuediscussion on the substance of reform in restructuring the economy andmanagement. Recent global trends of rising mineralraw materials, which determines the country&#39;s economy, led to a reductionoutput in the aluminum industry more than 20 times inoil industry - by 40%, ferrous metallurgy - 25%. Gradually growing environmental problems.</p> 
<p>In Japan, adopted the program &quot;Technopolis&quot;, it involves construction19 scientific bases for even medium-sized division of scientific personnel in the country. Today, 80% of scientists andengineers working in Tokyo and major cities.</p>
<p><strong>Industry</strong>. Japan - a highlypost-industrial country. Along with the giant companies are acting Numerous small, especially in the light and food industries. EconomyJapan depends on imports of raw materials and fuel, miningindustry makes 0.2% of GDP.</p>
<p><strong>Energetics</strong> country more than 80% dependent onenergy imports, but Japan ranks third in the worldproducing electricity. Almost 60% of its thermal power stations provide, operating on imported fuel (coal, natural gas, fuel oil)Japan&#39;s coal mining decreased (due to highcost) and the volume of its imports from Australia in particular.This is facilitated by commissioning new power station.</p>
<p>30% for nuclear power plants. 60% of fuel for nuclear power plants imported from Australia andCanada. The country is the world&#39;s largest nuclear power plant &quot;Fukushima&quot;, 53 nuclearreactors, 3 under construction and 13 are projected.</p>
<p>In the mid-90s of XX century. Japan ceded first place toChina&#39;s steel production, but today metallurgy of the country - one of the most advanced in the world. The world&#39;s largest metallurgical plantworks in Fukuyama. Two-thirds of molten steel in converters, the other - in Electric.</p>
<p>Because of high energy production of ferrous metals in Japanalmost fully drawn (especially aluminum), has a marked tendency to replacement of non-ferrous metals other materials (copper electric wiringreplaced by fiber optic cables). For Major Productschemicals Japan ranks second in the world (rubber, plastics,synthetic resin).</p>
<p>Japan on the world market - the main supplier of products of modernstructural materials, complex knowledge-intensive industries. To mid 90-ies of XX century. country was the world leader inautomotive industry, but gave the United States. Today the country remainsmajor exporter of cars, here are the biggest company industry &quot;Toyota Motor&quot;, &quot;Nissan Motor&quot;, &quot;Mytsubisi Motor&quot;, &quot;Honda Motor&quot;, &quot;Mazda Motor &quot;,&quot; Suzuki Motor. &quot; Markets finished goods industry -America, Europe, Australia. Automotive is the capital of Japan Nagoya, andlargest car plant works in Toyota. Automobilegiant &quot;Nissan Motor&quot; sold a large stake in French company&quot;Reno&quot; and the German-American concern &quot;Daimler-Chrysler&quot; bought the packageshares of companies &quot;Mytsubisi Motor&quot; and &quot;Honda Motor&quot;. These actions provide a positive result for further development, as open up opportunitiesaccess to new markets and modern technology.</p>
<p>&quot;Sony&quot;, &quot;Toshiba&quot;, &quot;Hitachi&quot;, &quot;Fuji&quot;, &quot;Sharp&quot; is the e-leadersindustry. The main centers of industry are Tokyo, Yokohama, Fudzisava,Kawasaki Itihara (Industrial Zone Keyhin.) Japan remains the worldleader in production of video cameras, video recorders, cameras.The country also controls one fifth of the global electronics manufacturing and the emission of integrated circuits, optical fibers, semiconductors,computers and components behind only the United States.</p>
<p>Japanese control panel formed at the four major ports and theirhinterlandu: Tokyo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Chiba. Their turnover - more than400 million tons per year, and specialization - receiving crude oil andRefining, Port ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, portHeat (in the Australian coal) sends generalgoods.</p>

<p>Geographically the country is divided into eight densely locatedeconomic regions, the most powerful of which is the Kanto (Tokyo, Tida,Kawasaki, Yokohama, specialization - electronics, shipbuilding, the scopeservices), Kinki (Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, electronics, ferrous and nonferrousmetallurgy, chemical industry) and Chubu (Nagoya, Toyota, Hamamatsu;Specialization - automotive, cars district allows a thirdcountry), belonging to Pacific Industrial bands thatconcentrated almost 80% of the population and economic potential.40% of GDP gives Kanto - the main industrial areas of the country. O.Kyushu is called &quot;silicone&quot; due to the high level of development hereelectronics industry. District Tohoyuku with economic center inHirosymi specializes in heavy, including shipbuilding.Ura-Nippon - agricultural &quot;back&quot; side of Japan stretches alongSea of</p>
<p><strong>Agriculture</strong> in the country is onintensive basis. But in terms of populationown agricultural products compared to other developedof Japan is far behind. Completely cover the needs of their country only in rice, vegetables and eggs, the demand for fruits is met by 75% inmilk and dairy products - by 80% in veal - 64% more. Inagriculture used the largest plain area -Kanto, Tokyo and, on the island. Honshu, Isikari on the island. Hokkaido others. Theyalmost completely finished, but land suitable for farming, inJapan had. Dominated by small landholdings (land mostly to 1.5ha.). The bulk of the products gives crop, leading culturewhich is rice. Developed as vegetable growing and gardening. Traditionallydeveloped floriculture.</p>
<p>Japan is among the highest in the world of fishing and mining seafood. Bred cattle, pigs, birds,silkworm.</p>
<p>Were formed clearly determined the suburban agriculturalspecialization, the main of which is a band from valley to valley Kanto Kinki in within the Tokaido megalopolis.</p>
<p><strong>Transport</strong>. Japan has one of the most developedtransport networks of the world, which is a feature of almost complete absencepipeline and maritime transport. 55% of freight and 67%performs passenger road transport. Fleet Japansecond only to USA. The total length of roads, about 1.2 millionkm, the density and length of roads under the country ranks first andfive cities in the world. Sea transport is dominated in foreign tradecountry and second largest cargo turnover and the thirdpassenger. Main ports: Kobe, Chiba, Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka,Kawasaki, Tokyo, Hakodate, Kitakyusyu.</p>
<p><strong>Length of railways</strong> - More than 20.1 thousand km, but the rolerail transport in recent times is reduced, it is secondpassenger seat and plays a minor role in turnover. Thereoperate high-speed railways, the first of them &quot;Tokaido-Synkansen&quot;operate between Osaka and Tokyo since 1964 Maximum speed is300 km per hour., Path length 515 km. By day she is carrying more than 375thousand passengers. A train consisting of 16 carriages.</p>
<p>The main air gate of the country - Haneda International Airport in Tokyo, an area over 500 hectares, and the length of the runway is 3500 m of the largest airports in the world is also in the airportOsaka. In addition, international airports are in urban Fukuoka,Kagoshima, Kansai, Nagoya. In 2003, the countries adopted a program of further development of aviation from the creation of the first domestic jetairliner.</p>
<p>Between the islands there are ferries, bridges, underwater tunnels, the largest of them between Honshu and Hokkaido has a length of 53 km. Over 40% of householdsfarms and 90% of enterprises in the country using Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Foreign economic relations.</strong> In totalforeign trade in Japan is second only to the U.S. and Germany. Export:Machinery and equipment, including transport (over 68% of cost)semiconductors, steel, ships, chemicals, textiles.Main partners: U.S., China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Japan - the biggest world importer of liquefied natural gas andsecond largest importer of oil. Imported as machines andequipment, fuel, food products, chemicals industry,fabrics, raw materials, mainly from China, USA, SaudiArabia, UAE, Australia, South Korea, Indonesia.</p>
<p>Significant revenue GDP of Japan is the world&#39;s tourism. Amongprominent tourist sites of the country - many national and natural parks and architectural complexes, museums, Shinto and Buddhist temples.</p>
