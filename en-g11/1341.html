<p><strong>Mineral resources. </strong></p>
<p>Housekeeper for any state at the current stage of developmentof particular importance mineral resources. Mineralresources - natural substances of mineral origin that is used in economy as raw material or energy source. They are fundamentalmaterial production and use in all its branches.</p>

Ratingof mineral resources may vary over time. Throughscientific and technological advances are available to operate more and new fields.</p>
<p>Mineral resources (fuel, metal, engineering, constructionmaterials) because of them extracted raw material for various industrialproductions, often called <em>minerals</em></p>
<p>In the earth&#39;s crust has more than 200 kinds of mineral resources, includingproduce more than 160. Annually from the earth&#39;s interior producing over 120 billion tons various raw materials and fuel. Modern accommodation mineralsworld - is the result of long and complex process of geological development Earth. It is closely related to geological and tectonic structure.The natural accumulation of minerals known deposits, and accumulationdeposits - Pool minerals.</p>
<p>Mineral resources depending on the scope of their use of sharedfor: fuel and energy (coal, oil, natural gas, uranium, thoriumshale oil, etc.) ore (ore iron, foundry and refractory;ferrous, precious metals), non-metallic: a) steel (fluxes,refractory), b) mining and chemical (apatites, nepheline, rock, potassiumsalt, sulfur, sulfur kidney, barium, phosphorus), c) technical (Diamond,plaster, natural stone).</p>

<p>Fuel and energy resources of the world pretty significant, but they are to comprehensive and irretrievable. In their structure dominated by coal(Black and brown) - 75%. Its resources are concentrated in 3 thousand pools in75 countries mainly Northern Hemisphere. 2 / 3 of world reservescoal comes from four countries: USA, Russia, India and China.The most powerful in the world coalfield - Tunhuskyy, Lensky,Kuznetsk, Ruhr and Appalachian. ? world reserves of brown coalfalls on the U.S. and Russia.

<p>Oil and gas, due to similar geological origin in mostcases occur together. Today, the world&#39;s prospected over 600oil and gas basins. Over? world&#39;s oil is concentrated inSaudi Arabia. Almost? gas reserves accounted for Russia and the countriesNear and Middle East.</p>

<p>Essential stocks of nuclear fuel for nuclear power - uranium - Allocated U.S., Canada, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia.</p>

<p>By using ore ores are divided into:</p>

The bulk of diamonds is concentrated in three areas: inSouth Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Namibia), in Australia andRussia (Yakutia). Asbestos reserves differ Russia (Ural), SouthAfrica, Zimbabwe and Canada. Graphite deposits are located in Russia, China,India, Sweden, Mexico.</p> 
<p>Provision of regional stocks of various types of mineralresources played a large role in forming and placing manyareas of the world economy. Use of mineral raw materials,the level of its involvement in production, the degree of technological and environmentaltreatment is an indicator of the economy. Economicallydeveloped countries tend to act as a consumer of mineralresources, and developing countries, their producers and exporters.</p>
<p>Land. One of the greatest wealth of any country isits land resources. Land - part of the earth&#39;s surfacesuitable for life and commercial activity. The territory alsocan be considered a kind of resource. It serves as the basis for spatiallocations of all branches of the main means of productionagriculture and forestry. The area has become a kind ofdeficit, especially in small room, but with numerouspopulation countries (Japan, Netherlands, Denmark).</p>

<p><strong>Water resources.</strong></p>
<p>Water - one of the most common and specific substances in nature.It is believed that life originated in water on our planet. Water resources -surface and ground water used or can beuse in economic activities.</p>

<p>Water resources are divided into fresh water land, includingsurface water (rivers, lakes, glaciers, artificial ponds, marshes) Yigroundwater, water seas and oceans.</p>
<p>In the water of the oceans for 71% of the world. With 31.4billion km3 volume of water of the hydrosphere, about 96.5% is the Ocean, 1,7% - of underground water, 1,7% - on ice, less than 0,01% - tosurface water (rivers, lakes, swamps).</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Using water icebergs - one wayreduce water shortages</strong></p>
<p>First, demand is fresh water. The main source of freshwater for industry, agriculture, domestic needs were remaining river water. They are unevenly distributed. Topthe full resources of the river flow is concentrated in Asia and LatinAmerica, and the least endowed with this resource is Australia.</p>

<p>Woods - &quot;lungs&quot; of our planet. They play an important klimatotvirnu, water and soil protection, erosion and recreational role. Forestresources belong to the exhaustive, but renewable resources. Forests aresource of wood, used in construction and furnitureindustry. Wood also provides raw materials for the production of resin, cork,raw materials for synthetic fibers. In the woods hunting industry focusland, food (nuts, berries, mushrooms) resources.</p>
<p>Forests cover about 25% of the planet&#39;s surface. It is 41 million km2land. Wood stock - 330 billion m3. This figure is constantly changing:forest grows, it cut down. Unfortunately, the pace of forest clearing rates exceedingrecovery.</p>
<p>Conditionally all world forests are divided into two zones: the north, including Forests in temperate, subtropical zones, and south, coveringequatorial area, subekvatorialnoho and tropical zones.</p>
<p>Half of the forests is on the northern forest zone. It ismainly coniferous forests. A significant portion of this forest belongs to RussiaCanada, the United States. Among the northern forest zone is to provideFinland, Sweden, where the share of territory covered by forests is 60%.</p>
