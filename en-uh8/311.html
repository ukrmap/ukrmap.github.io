It is worth remembering that while the referendum was that of participation even in the discussion of these problems were alienated the peasantry, which constituted the majority population. (Of course, at that time in solving these problems have not participated and women). Orthodox clergy refused to swear as well as the Zaporizhzhya Sich. Hence, only part of the population Hetman (Cossacks with the gentry and townsfolk), and not all gave the oath. We know that from participation in the oath avoided several regiments, prominent figures of the National Liberation War (I. Bogun, J. deaf, G. Gulyanitskii, I. Sirko et al.). It should be noted that the oath and geographically covered only Naddniprianshchyna.</p> <p> <b> <i> text of the treaty in 1654 </i> </b> in the usual for a modern diplomatic practice never existed. Specifics of the contract was that it concluded the three (not all!) States, each separately. Ukrainian Orthodox clergy refused after concluding a contract; commoners satisfied confirmation of their rights and liberties granted by Polish kings and Grand Dukes of Lithuania, and in so-called Articles of March, concluded its own Cossack delegation agreement was reached to 17 articles (of 23). Of the six important part of the parties have not reached consensus, several important aspects of Ukrainian-Russian relations were not reflected in the contract in 1654 historians generally agree that the agreement was incomplete and imperfect, but equal and mutually beneficial. Acted, however, it is a very short time and already in 1656, he was rudely interrupted by Moscow (Vilna truce). Because of this, the Ukrainian government made a military alliance with Sweden and Transylvania in 1656, and in 1658 signing Hadiach Covenant finally broke the Ukrainian-Russian agreement in 1654 was later launched the Russian-Ukrainian war 1658-1659 biennium, which lost to Ukraine and its government was forced to sign a contract Pereyaslavs&#39;kyi 1659, this time is unequal, which ended the state of independence. <i> (YA Mytsyk). </i></p><p style="text-align: center"> <b> UKRAINIAN RELATIONS BETWEEN STATE AND Muscovy </b></p><ul><li> from the end of 1648 between the Hetmanate and Moscow State began a constant exchange of embassies. </li><li> Hetman government concerned about the possibility of establishing relations with the Commonwealth of Muscovy. After all, they pinned Polyanivskyy peace treaty in 1634 that the king did not dare to violate in order not to give the Polish government over a new war. </Li><li> same time in Moscow was ready to assist the Commonwealth, there was no transfer of large military formations in Moscow-Ukrainian border. <b> <i> Moscow waited until both sides of the Ukrainian-Polish War znesylyatsya and beware of the flame Cossack rebellion that could spill over to Moscow lands. </I> </b> </li><li> To push the government to the royal union with Zaporozhian Host, inc in June 1653 made it clear to the king: if he continues zvolikatyme to solve the Ukrainian issue, then Ukraine will enter into a union with Turkey. In addition, Hetman said the very unpleasant consequences of such a union for Muscovy. </Li><li> <b> <i> October 1, 1653 </i> </b> Moscow Zemsky Sobor decided: <i> &quot;... Bohdan Khmelnytsky and all the host cities and Zaporozhian to take land&quot; </i> and go to war against Poland. In connection with the decision of the Provincial council to Ukraine was assigned a large embassy, led by boyar Vasily Buturlin.

The basic idea of these articles - the establishment of such inter-state relations under which Ukraine will remain both internally and externally independent. It is for these sexes Ukrainian embassy arrived in Moscow.

In support of John Bohun, who led the defense Uman went Cossack units Khmelnytsky and 10-12000th Muscovite army. This made the Polish-Tatar command to lift the siege and to return the army to meet the Ukrainian-Moscow forces. </Li><li> January 19, 1655 Polish-Tatar army surrounded the Ukrainian-Moscow camp in the village Ohmatovym (now in Cherkasy region.). The siege lasted several days and exhausted rivals. Particularly plagued frost. Contemporaries called the battle &quot;field shakiness, or Dryzhypolem, and the battle of Ohmatovym - Dryzhypilskoyu battle. </Li><li> Ohmativska battle ended with a slight advantage of the Ukrainian army, but Bogdan Khmelnitsky failed to inflict a decisive blow Polish-Tatar army and liberate her from the territory Bratslavshchina. </Li><li> spring of 1655 Khmelnytsky went through the skirts of the army in Galicia. The aim of the campaign was free from Polish domination in western lands and unite Ukraine in its ethnic borders. In early August, the army stopped near Kamenets-Podolsky. </Li><li> During the siege of Hetman received the Swedish ambassador. He reported on July 9 join Sweden in the war against Poland.

Soon Hetman received ransom and retreated from the city. </Li><li> After the Battle of Lake town November 12, 1655 agreement was concluded between the hetman and the Crimean khan. It included non-interference in Crimea, Ukraine and Moscow&#39;s war against Poland.
