He chose the latter, thinking that it is better to havePoland&#39;s pro-Russian forces in power and control the entire country, than get itpart and second part - hostile. But the rotation did not suitIvan Mazepa, who made a bid to Sweden, hoping to wrest from Russia andPoland throughout Ukraine. But defeat at Poltava Swedish troops in 1709crossed his plans.</span></p>
