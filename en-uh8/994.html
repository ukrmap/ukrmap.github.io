During this period the church life in Ukrainedeveloped by foreign and gentile Polish-Lithuanian authorities. While proclaimingtolerant attitude toward Orthodoxy, the rights and privileges of the Orthodoxchurch, there were significant reasons that caused a deep crisis of church life,demoralized and dezorhanizuvaly it. However, during this period developedfollowing features of Ukrainian Orthodoxy as active participation in the lifechurch laymen and convergence of church life, spiritual education and schools,forced to resist the offensive of Latin culture, Catholicism and Reformationmovements.</span></p>

After the Lublinunion situation deteriorated. Polish kings were the law of patronage, &quot;givingspiritual bread and giving spiritual capital, appointing bishops andArchimandrite (Abbot) for money.
