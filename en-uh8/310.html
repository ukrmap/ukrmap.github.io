Since 1918 - as part of Romania.</p><p style="text-align: center"> <b> restoration of military action. Berestetskaya BATTLE </b></p><ul><li> In 1650 Poland was preparing for a new phase of war against Bohdan Khmelnytsky. </li><li> Military actions started on the night against the February 10, 1651 crown army led by the Anti-Monopoly Hetman Kalinowski Martin captured the town of Krasne in Podolia. In fierce fighting killed almost all Bratslav Cossacks Regiment. </Li><li> from under Krasny part Kalinovskiy winery went on, intending to make her strong point further offensive in late February and have already started the siege. But fighting in Vinnytsia were unsuccessful for the Poles and significantly weakened the army Kalinovskiy. </Li><li> decisive battles between the main forces of Polish and Ukrainian armies occurred <b> <i> 18-30 June 1651 </i> </b> near the town Berestechko in Volhynia. The place was chosen for the battle between the rivers Stir and Plyashivka. In the morning of June 18 the first skirmishes erupted. </Li><li> Berestetskaya battle was the largest battle of the National Liberation War of the number of soldiers who took part in it. </li><li> During the main battle, on June 20, when the benefit was already on the side of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, Horde suddenly left the battlefield: it turned out, the Crimean Khan Islam-would not defeat the Polish army, so before negotiations began with the king. </Li><li> Cossack forces to escape from a crushing defeat, inc decided to withdraw the army to the river Plyashivka, marsh banks which can reliably protect the rear of the Cossack army. Commanded to build fortifications to strengthen the camp, the hetman went for the Khan, to get back the horde on the battlefield. <b> <i> But Khan actually shut Bohdan Khmelnytsky. </I> </b> </li>Within 10 days <li> Cossacks heroically defended the camp, beating out all the attacks of the Poles. </Li><li> was elected acting hetman Ivan Bohun.

In August of marriage took Tymish Rozandoyu. </Li><li> Concerned Ukrainian-Moldovan Union, Poland, Wallachia and Transylvania were united in anti-coalition. In April 1653 the owner of Matthew Basarab Wallachian and Transylvanian Prince George (Dyerd) II R<li> <b> <i> 21-22 April 1653 </i> </b> Ukrainian troops, led by Tymish Khmelnytsky, troops smashed the new Moldavian master.

Tymish Khmelnytsky army returned to the Ukraine. </Li>Military assistance <li> Lupul did not stop strife for power in Moldova. Lupu again soon dropped from the throne. Once in trouble, he again enlisted the help of the Cossacks. True allied commitments, the Ukrainian army, headed by Timosha, embarked on a campaign. Things did not favor Timosha. In the fortress of Suceava Cossacks came under siege. During the heroic defense Timosha was mortally wounded. </Li> </ul><p style="text-align: center"> <b> Zhvanets&#39;ka Siege </b></p><ul><li> Batozka victory meant a quick end to a war against Poland.

Polish camp was taken in a long siege, which had exhausted the enemy army. The Polish camp of famine, epidemics broke out. And the final defeat of the Poles have once again saved the Horde. </Li><li> <b> <i> December 5 </i> </b> Khan and king of Poland, entered into an oral agreement under which hostilities ceased, the Tatars were given permission to yasyr at Western. Interests of Ukraine Kamenetskiy agreement were not accounted for, because it provided for restoration of conditions Zborivsky treaty no longer satisfied the Ukrainian people. </Li> </ul><p> <b> <i> Thus, despite the successful military actions, hity implications campaign for the Ukrainian Hetman State, however, are unfavorable. </I> </b></p><p style="text-align: center"> <b> internal and foreign Hetmanate SITUATION END 1653 </b></p><p> Given the protracted war situation of the Ukrainian state steadily deteriorated.</p><ul><li> particularly severe it was in autumn 1653 Six years of war exhausted Ukraine. As a result, Polish punitive campaigns, horde robberies, permanent mobilization of the population, epidemics of plague and cholera have been devastated by more than 100 cities and towns on the Right Bank, the territory znelyudnily Bratslavshchina and Kyiv. </Li><li> agriculture declined. Impoverished Cossacks could no longer perform military service. Were increasingly difficult to mobilize. For example, during the mobilization in August-September 1653 inc managed to collect only 30-40 thousand troops. Fatigue and frustration was growing in the nation. To escape the invaders fled to the Ukrainian and Muscovite Slobidska. Began to spark unrest peasants and ordinary Cossacks against the Hetman government policy. </Li><li> international situation worsened and the Ukrainian state. Rzeczpospolita, Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania were united in the anti union. Crimean khan too often in big moments betrayed Ukrainian, so union with him seemed uncertain. As to Poland, it is not zmyryvshys the existence of the Ukrainian state was preparing for a new offensive. </Li> </ul><p> <b> <i> To preserve the main achievements of war </i> </b> <i>, first state, the Ukrainian government concluded <b> the need to seek an alliance with the Muscovite tsar, or Turkish sultan </b>.
